    <span> <div class="title">The Big Hole</div>
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_big_hole">The Big Hole</a> is an experimental project designed by myself and edited by <a href="https://izzyhardisty.squarespace.com/">Izzy Hardisty</a>. The project aims to document and respond to "The Big Hole", the site formerly City Square. Since April 2017, the site has been closed off to the public, as construction of the new Town Hall Station, part of the Metro Tunnel, takes place. The first run of 150 copies of The Big Hole is now sold out.
