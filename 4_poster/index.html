  <p> If we were to dispose of the city now, </p>
  <h5> <p> future societies would reconstruct them. </p> </h5>
  <h2> We look at the present through a rear view mirror. </h2>
  <p> Environments are <h3> invisible. </h3> </p>
  <p> The amateur can afford to lose. The "expert" is the man who stays affloat. </p>
  <p> The young today reject goals. </p>
