<span> <div class="title">Fauxvenir</div>
  Fauxvenir is a series of false souvenirs that allow time-poor tourists to pretend they have visited a place they never had time to see. The items were given out for free to passersbys in Florence, and documented in a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5gIyEk0SjSg">here</a>. This was a collaborative project between myself, James Meadowcroft, Leitu Bonnici and Lakshan Dharmapriya during a semester in Monash University, Prato.

<span> <div class="title">The Big Hole</div>
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_big_hole">The Big Hole</a> is an experimental project designed by myself and edited by Izzy Hardisty. Our first publication aims to document and respond to "The Big Hole", the site formerly City Square. Since April 2017, the site has been closed off to the public, as construction of the new Town Hall Station, part of the Metro Tunnel, takes place. Publication coming in November 2018.
