      HESTER EISENSTEIN  </id> <br>
    <id class="strong"> Entry: </id> 6:45pm Sunday, 17 March 2019 <br>
    <id class="strong"> Type: </id> Book <br>
    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> Feminism Seduced: How Global Elites Use Women's Labor And Ideas To Exploit The World <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> This text is a lot less about culture than I originally had hoped, and more about the history of feminism and labor (which is also insightful). I came across this text after reading Eva Chen's <id class ="emphasis"> Neoliberalism and Popular Women's Culture, </id> as Eisenstein was referenced. <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> I have not managed to read the whole thing, and unsure if I will as it is only lightly about aesthetics. However, here is something I picked up from my read today: <br>
    We have seen a shift from labor feminism, to mainstream feminism. The popularisation of feminism has been achieved, yet today’s feminism is less about embracing social change and more about aesthetics, which ultimately spells its obsoleteness.
    <br>
    Because of this proliferation of feminist ideologies, there are numerous types of feminism, including socialist feminism, neoliberal feminism and radical feminism to name a few. For this reason, many people now refer to “feminisms” as a plural, as these ideologies are extremely different.<br>

    <id class="strong"> Entry: </id> 6:48pm Sunday, 17 March 2019 <br>
    <id class="strong"> Type: </id> Article from Journal <br>
    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> Neoliberalism and Popular Culture <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> This article was really interesting as the writer speaks directly to how students of popular culture are confused by the usage of the word Neoliberalism. And really, same! I liked how he described the word as a product of buzzword culture and that it is an "already exhausted" term. This was also a great take on academia and terminology - why use words that no one knows the meaning of? <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> Buzzwords are symptomatic of the neoliberal era, and the word “neoliberalism” could be said to be a product of circulating tricky terminology in academic circles.
  To be put in simple terms, Neoliberalism refers to the effect of the past 50 years’ capitalism in culture and economics.</id> <br>

    AKANE KANAI  </id> <br>
    <id class="strong"> Entry: </id> 11:24 Friday, 22 March 2019 <br>
    <id class="strong"> Type: </id> Article from Journal <br>
    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> The Girl In The GIF: Reading the Self into Girlfriendship <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> I loved this!! Kanai writes about girlhood with a great respect for the culture young girls co-create. Her whole PHD is centered around girlhood and being online, and this specific essay positioned reading as an active, social, and affective act. <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> I enjoyed rethinking the idea of reading and the productivity of being online. I have spent a huge amount of my life online, and often (what often felt like) wasted away reblogging, looking at content, and curating feeds. <br>
  Kanai speaks about the unique nature of the "reading" that young girls do each day online, and the assertion of the self into another "gendered social imaginary" that takes place on sites like Tumblr. Specifically referring to the blog WhatShouldWeCallMe, she repositions something thought of as passive, into something productive and affective. </id> <br>

    THEA BALLARD </id> <br>
    <id class="strong"> Entry: </id> 11:37 Friday, 22 March 2019 <br>
    <id class="strong"> Type: </id> Essay published on the web <br>
    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> Girls' Room <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> After our class on Monday, Liz Luby told me I should read this article, I assume partly because we had seen Liz Phair play live together a couple weeks prior, but also because it fit in with where my research was headed. I read it that night! (Thanks Liz Luby). Thea Ballard writes about the authenticity of Liz Phair's music, and the effect her legacy has had on recent early 20s female musicians making "bedroom" pop. <br>
    Liz Phair's Girlysound music was vulnerable, messy, juvenile and extremely, self depreciatingly, feminine.
    <br>
    It seems as though Liz Phair has paved the way for artists such as Soccer Mommy (who opened for Phair's show recently), Snail Mail (who gets compared to Phair constantly), and even people like Mitski (who can barely be called a Bedroom artist anymore due to her huge success.)
    <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> One bit in particular that I ended up texting back to Liz excited was the following. <br> <br>
  "We call it bedroom pop, but if intimate space and our transmissions from within it are so professionalized, is there even a proverbial bedroom to make music from anymore?"
<br> <br>
This part in particular resonated with me. The bedroom has always been a space in which young girls might feel most safe, as it acts as their haven and cocoon. The genre of Bedroom Pop has become commodified to now signify something unprofessional, DIY, even though it may be the oppposite, is extremely bizarre.
