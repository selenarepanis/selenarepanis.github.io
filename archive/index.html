    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> Feminism Seduced: How Global Elites Use Women's Labor And Ideas To Exploit The World <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> This text is a lot less about culture than I originally had hoped, and more about the history of feminism and labor (which is also insightful). I came across this text after reading Eva Chen's <id class ="emphasis"> Neoliberalism and Popular Women's Culture, </id> as Eisenstein was referenced. <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> I have not managed to read the whole thing, and unsure if I will as it is only lightly about aesthetics. However, here is something I picked up from my read today: <br>
    We have seen a shift from labor feminism, to mainstream feminism. The popularisation of feminism has been achieved, yet today’s feminism is less about embracing social change and more about aesthetics, which ultimately spells its obsoleteness.
    <br>
    Because of this proliferation of feminist ideologies, there are numerous types of feminism, including socialist feminism, neoliberal feminism and radical feminism to name a few. For this reason, many people now refer to “feminisms” as a plural, as these ideologies are extremely different.<br>

    <id class="strong"> Title: </id> Neoliberalism and Popular Culture <br>
    <id class="strong"> Review: </id> This article was really interesting as the writer speaks directly to how students of popular culture are confused by the usage of the word Neoliberalism. And really, same! I liked how he described the word as a product of buzzword culture and that it is an "already exhausted" term. This was also a great take on academia and terminology - why use words that no one knows the meaning of? <br>
    <id class="strong"> A Passage: </id> Buzzwords are symptomatic of the neoliberal era, and the word “neoliberalism” could be said to be a product of circulating tricky terminology in academic circles.
  To be put in simple terms, Neoliberalism refers to the effect of the past 50 years’ capitalism in culture and economics.</id> <br>
