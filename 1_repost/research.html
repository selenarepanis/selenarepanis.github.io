<h1>Idea 1</h1>

  <h2>Karaoke Video</h2>

<p> Idea one surrounds the concept of Karaoke and performance. Karaoke videos are outdated, nostalgic and cheesy, often using strange video footage in the background or some graphics. </p>

<p>I would create a karaoke video using tourists’ footage of Niagara Falls posted on Youtube, paired, or inspired by the “blog post”  I found on UBU. This would be reposted on Youtube. </P>

<h1>Idea 2</h1>

    <h2>So It's The Next Day Now</h2>

<p> Idea two talks about the current Vlogging culture existing on Youtube and the people who create them - usually 20 year olds who have “influencer” occupations. </P>

<p> This idea picks one phrase that is used very often in vlogs:
<blockquote>  “So its the next day now”, </blockquote>
and collages many instances of this phrase in difference vlogs in one video to be reposted on Youtube.  </p>

<h1>Idea 3</h1>

    <h2>On hold</h2>

<p> Idea three looking into multi tasking. Often when I'm watching some video online I'm also texting.</P>

<p> I would be using photobooth videos of myself waiting On Hold and watching something on my screen at the same time. </p>
<p> Perhaps things would come up on the screen, or the viewing screen would have my screencast activity, as well as my photobooth footage of myself waiting. </P>
