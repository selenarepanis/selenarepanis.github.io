<h4> <u> 1. GIVE UP GOOGLING YR OLD BOYFRIEND AND JUST CALL ME TO RECITE A POEM ALREADY </u> </h4>


<h3> <p>I’m awake after hours of dreams sinking into the air mattress and watching Valentino on Youtube. </p>
<p> I should just do this more often, wake up to watch his saintly self sketching stacks of wedding gowns. </p>
<p> I don’t wait for the day to get married, </p>
<p> too impatient for the production of love-things. </p>

    <h4> <u> 2. LIGHTS BRIGHT THERE </u> </h4>
<h3> <p> Manny Pacquiao boxing for survival at the MGM Grand on Youtube seems </p>
<p> like he wins because he fights out of love; punches for millions of Filipinos, </p>
<p> jabs for the country’s recovery after major typhoons, right hooks a face for those
<p> preoccupied with so many things like hunger and karaoke. </p>
<p> Boxing is less of metaphor and more like a narrative unfolding. </p>
<p> Dude makes the sign of the cross on forehead and chest before every round, </p>
<p> as though he were fighting for something greater, </p>
<p> not knowing what, but obedient to it, </p>
<p> obedient to Jesus and the things he boxes for. </p>
<br>
<p> He listens to his opponent’s impulses and waits. </p>
<p> Like waiting for the right timing to sing a neon pink line of karaoke text floating across a screen. </p>
<p> Punctuation. Karaoke. Punches. </p>
