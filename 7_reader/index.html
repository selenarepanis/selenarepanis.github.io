On The Social Media Ideology.  ----- Geert Lovink
<br>
<br>
<br>
Contradictory consciousness-management
has superseded social anxiety about Bad Faith.
This has long been the thesis of Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. <img src="assets/inserts/zizek.png" class="col1of8">
Let's work on this thesis and take seriously the
cynical statement "They know what they do, but
they do it anyway" and apply this to social media. <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8">
There is no longer a need to investigate the
potential of "new media" and deconstruct their
intentions. The internet <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> has reached its
hegemonic stage. In previous decades it was
premature to associate intensive 24/7 usage by
millions with deep structures such as the
(sub)conscious. Now that we live fully in social
media times, it has become pertinent to do
precisely that: link techne with psyche.
<br>
<br>

The revelations of Edward Snowden <img src="assets/inserts/snowden.png" class="col1of8"> arrived
long after our daily surf-and-swap <img src="assets/inserts/surf.png" class="col1of8"> routines had
become firmly entrenched. We know we're
watched by surveillance systems <img src="assets/inserts/surveillance.png" class="col1of8"> but who can
honesty claim to constantly be aware of them?
Artistic masks <img src="assets/inserts/mask.png" class="col1of8"> are promoted as protective face
shields yet who wears them? The internet may
be broken, <img src="assets/inserts/broken.png" class="col1of8"> as the phrase goes (and IT engineers
have reached a consensus about this troubling
analysis), but this cannot be said of social
media. Like Snowden's revelations, Sherry
Turkle's <img src="assets/inserts/turkle.png" class="col1of8"> evidence about smartphones inhibiting
one's empathy and ability to enjoy the virtues of
solitude have arrived late in the social media
game. How hard has it become to confront
offline boredom? <img src="assets/inserts/boredom.png" class="col1of8"> It's a straight-up torture.
<br>
<br>
The slogan "You are what you share" <img src="assets/inserts/share.png" class="col1of10">
(Charles Leadbeater) expresses the
transformation of the autonomous unit of the
self into an outgoing entity that is constantly
reproducing its social capital through the
transmission of value (data) to others. Let's face
it: we refuse to perceive ourselves as "slaves of
the machine." <img src="assets/inserts/slavetothemachine.png" class="col1of8"> What does it mean when we all
agree that there is an addictive element to
today's social media use, yet none of us is
apparently addicted? <img src="assets/inserts/addiction.png" class="col1of8"> Are we really returning only
sporadically? What exactly is being captured
here? If anything, we're encapsulated by the
social sphere <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> as such, not by the software, nor by
the protocols, network architectures, or the
assuredly infantile interfaces.
<br>
<br>
Under this spell of desire for the social, led
by the views and opinions of our immediate
social circle <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8">, our daily routines are as follows:
view recent stories first, fine-tune filter
preferences, <img src="assets/inserts/lady.png" class="col1of8"> jump to first unread, update your
life with events, clear and refresh all, not now,
save links to read for later, <img src="assets/inserts/woman.png" class="col1of8"> see full conversation,
mute your ex, set up a secret board, run a poll,
comment <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8"> through the social plug-in, add video to
your profile, choose between love, <img src="assets/inserts/love.png" class="col1of8"> haha,<img src="assets/inserts/haha.png" class="col1of8"> wow, <img src="assets/inserts/wow.png" class="col1of8">
sad, and angry, engage with those who mention
you while tracking the changes in relationship
status of others, follow a key opinion leader,
receive notifications, create a photo spread that
links to your avatar, repost a photo, get lost in the
double-barrel river of your timeline, prevent
friends <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8"> from seeing updates, check out
something based on a recommendation,
customize cover images, create 'must-click'
headlines, chat <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">with a friend while noticing that
1,326,595 people like this topic. <img src="assets/inserts/wow.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>

Social networking <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> is much more than just a
dominant discourse. We need to go beyond text
and images and include its software, interfaces,
and networks that depend on a technical
infrastructure consisting of offices and their
consultants and cleaners, cables and data
centers, working in close concert with the
movements and habits of the connected billions.
Academic internet studies circles have shifted
their attention from utopian promises, impulses,
and critiques to "mapping" the network's impact.
<br>
<br>

From digital humanities to data science we see a
shift in network-oriented inquiry from Whether
and Why, What and Who, to (merely) How. From a
sociality of causes to a sociality of net effects. A
new generation of humanistic researchers is
lured into the "big data" trap, and kept busy
capturing user behavior whilst producing
seductive eye candy for an image-hungry <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8">
audience (and vice versa).
<br>
<br>
Without noticing, we have arrived at a new,
yet unnamed, stage: the hegemonic era of social
media platforms as ideology. <img src="assets/inserts/lightbulb.png" class="col1of8"> Products and
services are of course usually subject to
ideology. We have learned to "read"  <img src="assets/inserts/read.png" class="col1of8">ideology into
them. But at what point can we convincingly say
they have become ideology themselves? It is one
thing to state that Mark Zuckerberg <img src="assets/inserts/mark.png" class="col1of8"> (founder of
Facebook) is an ideologue, working in the service
of US intelligence agencies, or to document
community or political groups using his social
media platform in ways unplanned or counter to
expectations inherent to its design. It is quite
another to work on a comprehensive social
media  <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8">theory. It is a crucial time for critical
theory to reclaim lost territory and bring on
exactly this: a shift from the quantitative to the
qualitative, uncomputable impacts of this
ubiquitous formatting of the social. It is
liberating for research to sever itself from the
instrumental approach of (viral) marketing and
public relations. Stop pushing, start analyzing. <img src="assets/inserts/lightbulb.png" class="col1of8">
Network technologies are rapidly becoming the
"new normal," withdrawing their operations and
governance from view. We need to politicize the
New Electricity, the privately owned utilities of
our century, before they disappear into the
background.
<br>
<br>
The 2008 chapter of internet criticism is
coming to a close. For the next round of The
Critique of the Political Economy, the internet
and digital technologies will have to be fully
integrated. The easy opposition of California
utopians vs. Euro pessimists has been
superseded by much larger planetary issues
such as the future of work. We need to take
internet critique beyond the normative regulation
of behavior and politicize the anxiety of the youth
and their particular addictions and distractions.
We have long come to terms with the actual and
virtual nature of the social, as its potential for
play and manipulation seems increasingly in
abeyance. Social media demand from us that we
perform in a never-ending show. We keep coming
back, always remaining logged in, until the
#DigitalDetox sets in and we're called to
different realms.
<br>
<br>
The social, political, and economic promise
of the internet as a decentralized network of
networks lies in tatters. Social media
alternatives, five years after their initial
appearance, haven't made much progress at all.5
Despite all well-intended critical predictions, the
herds have not moved on to greener pastures.
The overall picture is one of stagnation in a field
defined by the corporate domination of a handful
of players. We all remain stuck in the social
media mud, and it's time to ask why. Comparable
to the late-1970s stagnation in mainstream
media critique, a political economy approach will
not be sufficient if we want to come up with
workable strategies. One possible way out could
be a post-Freudian answer to the question:
What's on a User's Mind?6 We need to answer the
question as to what social media actually offer.
Which desires do they appeal to? Why is updating
such a seductive yet boring habit? Can we
develop a set of critical concepts that would
describe our compulsive attraction to social
media, without reducing that attraction to
addiction rhetoric?
<br>
<br>
A starting point for reading social media as
ideology would be Wendy Chun's 2004 essay on
the idea of "software" as ideology.7 Chun's work,
along with the work of Jodi Dean and others,
speaks strongly to the media theorist coming to
terms with the peak of neoliberal transition and
the triumph of proprietary software. The
prominence of ideology as a central term in
debates has faded away since the mid-1980s.
The backdrop of ideology theory in the 1970s was
the spectacular peaking of the power of the state
apparatus (also called the welfare state) that
was commissioned to administrate the postwar
class compromise. Whilst Daniel Bell's End of
Ideology, as announced in 1960, had arrived with
the victory of neoliberalism at the end of the Cold
War, there was an intuitive feeling that ideology -
with a small i - had not yet left the stage, and the
World Without Ideas was not yet within reach,
despite concerted efforts to diminish the role of
public intellectuals and critical discourses.
<br>
<br>
The "Californian ideology" as defined in
1995 by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron
helped us trace the motives underlying the
internet back to their Cold War roots (and the
ambivalent hippie culture). Fred Turner's 2006
classic From Counterculture to Cyberculture did
much the same. But the historical perspective is
not much use if it cannot explain social media's
contemporary and persistent success since the
1990s. Now, as in the 1970s, the role of ideology
in navigating the limits of existing systems is all
too real. To study ideology is to take a close look
at this everyday life, here and now. What remains
particularly unexplained is the apparent paradox
between the hyper-individualized subject and
the herd mentality of the social. What's wrong
with the social? What's right with it? Positivity is
as pervasive in California as it is in the Italian
cyberspace scene, which, in a Gramscian move,
has embraced the "social network" as a sign
within popular culture that the multitude can
beat the mainstream in its act of mediation.
Italian critics, activists, and artists are not unlike
many others in being hyperaware of all the
controversies that surround the products and
services made in Silicon Valley, while remaining
mostly positive about the magic potion called
social networking.
<br>
<br>
One function of ideology as defined by Louis
Althusser is recognition, the (in)famous
interpellation of the subject that is being called
upon.8 We can apply this and speak of the
process of becoming-user. This is the unnoticed
part of the social media saga. Before we enter
the social media sphere, everyone first fills out a
profile and choses a username and password in
order to create an account. Minutes later, you're
part of the game and you start sharing, creating,
playing, as if it has always been like that. The
profile is the a priori part and the profiling and
targeted advertising cannot operate without it.
The platforms present themselves as self-
evident. They just are - facilitating our feature-
rich lives. Everyone that counts is there. It is
through the gate of the profile that we become
its subject.
<br>
<br>
For Althusser, we live inside ideology in this
way - the formula applies in particular to social
media in which subjects are addressed as users
who do not exist without a profile. It is justified
to use this slightly authoritarian, hermetic
concept of ideology because of the highly
centralized top-down structure of social media
architecture in this age of platform capitalism,
which leaves zero space for users to reprogram
their communication spaces.
<br>
<br>
Despite all the postmodernism and cynical
neoliberalism that has deemed it redundant, it is
no surprise that ideology (again) rules. (It is more
remarkable how total the concept's fall from use
has been.) The main issue is that we are less and
less aware of how it rules. When it comes to
social media we have an "enlightened false
consciousness" in which we know very well what
we are doing when we are fully sucked in, but we
do it anyway. This even accounts at a meta-level
for the popularity of ≈Ωi≈æek's insights - and could
be one of the best explanations for his success.
We're all aware of the algorithmic manipulations
of Facebook's news feed, the filter-bubble effect
in apps, and the persuasive presence of
personalized advertisement. We pull in updates,
24/7, in a real-time global economy of
interdependencies, having been taught to read
news feeds as interpersonal indicators of the
planetary condition. So in what way does Louis
Althusser need updating?
<br>
<br>
Four decades after the Althusser era, we do
not associate ideology with the state in the same way
he and his followers did. To qualify Facebook
and Google as falling within the Althusserian
definition of "ideological state apparatus"
sounds odd, if not exotic. In this era of late
neoliberalism and right-wing populism, ideology
is associated with the market, not with the state,
which has withdrawn into the role of merely
securing the market. But lest we forget, it was
ideology theory itself that contributed to the
"crisis of marxism." It led the way in opening up
marxism to issues thrust to the fore by the
student movement, the rise of feminism, and
other "new social movements," and also
highlighted the stagnation and bankruptcy of the
Soviet Union. The growing interest in media and
"cultural studies" did the rest.
<br>
<br>
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, weakened
Communist parties could no longer "annex" and
overrule the rainbow of justice and redistribution
issues of the "properly" (or revolutionary) social
state, let alone its countercultural practices. The
tactics of overdetermination in the name of the
working class therefore no longer worked. The
so-called "patchwork of minorities," non-
applying themselves to the new normal, were left
literally to their own devices, without an
overarching political framework, let alone
organization (or antagonism). Within a decade,
two of the defining centripetal forces of Marxist
theory as ideology critique lost their dominance:
State and Party. The associated disappearance
of ideology as a main focus of attention in
philosophy and the social sciences turned into
the common belief that while "ideas still
mattered," they are no longer able to rule
people's lives. Nowadays, ideas are praised
because they can shape the future, but taken as
rules and norms they are believed to be too
messy to govern our contradictory everyday lives
under capital.
<br>
<br>
Treating social media as ideology means
observing how it binds together media, culture,
and identity into an ever-growing cultural
performance (and related "cultural studies") of
gender, lifestyle, fashion, brands, celebrity, and
news from radio, television, magazines, and the
web - all of this imbricated with the
entrepreneurial values of venture capital and
start-up culture, with their underside of
declining livelihoods and growing inequality.
Every user has their confession: "It's definitely
harder to avoid social media than it is to give into
it. Most people tend to give into it, because its
easier" (Adele).
<br>
<br>
Wendy Chun wrote her 2004 essay on
software as ideology in the golden 2.0 era of the
web, when software was coming to be
considered synonymous with - and confused
with - PCs and laptops. She wrote: "Software is
a functional analogue to ideology. In a formal
sense computers understood as comprising
software and hardware are ideology machines."
She noted that software "fulfills almost every
formal definition of ideology we have, from
ideology as false consciousness to Louis
Althusser's definition of ideology as a
√îrepresentation' of the imaginary relation of
individuals to their real conditions of existence.'"
In an age of installed, micro-perceptual effects
and streamed programming, ideology does not
merely refer to an abstract sphere where the
battle of ideas is being fought. Think more in line
with a Spinozan sense of embodiment - from the
repetitive strains of Tinder swiping, to text neck,
to the hunched-over-laptop syndrome.
<br>
<br>
What is crusted as orthodoxy in Althusser
needs some adaptation and updating, not only in
terms of a class analysis. But it is still
remarkable how smoothly an Althusserian
ideology framework fits today's world, as Chun
proves:
Software, or perhaps more precisely
operating systems, offer us an imaginary
relationship to our hardware: they do not
represent transistors but rather desktops and
recycling bins. Software produces users. Without
operating system (OS) there would be no access
to hardware; without OS no actions, no practices,
and thus no user. Each OS, through its
advertisements, interpellates a "user": calls it
and offers it a name or image with which to
identify.
<br>
<br>
We could say that social media performs
the same function, and is even more powerful.
"What are you doing?" said Twitter's original
phrase. The question marks the material roots of
social media. Social media platforms have never
asked "What are you thinking?" Or dreaming, for
that matter. Twentieth-century libraries are full
of novels, diaries, comic strips, and films in
which people expressed what are were thinking.
In the age of social media we seem to confess
less what we think. It's considered too risky, too
private. We share what we do, and see, in a
staged manner. Yes, we share judgments and
opinions, but no thoughts. Our Self is too busy for
that, always on the move, flexible, open, sporty,
sexy, and always ready to connect and express.
With 24/7 social visibility, apparatus and
application become one in the body. This is a
reversal of Marshall McLuhan's Extensions of
Man - we are now witnessing an Inversion of
Man. Once technology entangles our senses and
gets under our skin, distance collapses and we
no longer have any sense that we are bridging
distances. With Jean Baudrillard we could speak
of an implosion of the social into the hand-held
device in which an unprecedented accumulation
of storage capacity, computational power,
software, and social capital is crystallized.
Things get right in our face, our ears, steered by
our autonomous finger tips. This is what Michel
Serres admires so much in the navigational
plasticity of the mobile generation, the
smoothness of its gestures, symbolized in the
speed of the thumb, sending updates in seconds,
mastering mini-conversations, grasping the
mood of a global tribe in an instant. To stay
within the French realm of references: social
media as the apparatus of sexy and sporty
"active acting" makes it a perfect vehicle for the
literature of despair epitomized by Michel
Houellebecq's messy body(-politics).
<br>
<br>
The illusion with which the user surrounds
him- or herself while swiping and tapping
through social media updates feels natural and
self-evident for the very first time. There is no
steep learning curve or rite of passage; we need
not shed blood, sweat, and tears to fight our way
into the social hierarchy. From day one the
network configuration makes us feel at home, as
if WhatsApp, QQ, and Telegram have always
existed. Down the line, however, this immediate
familiarity becomes the main source of
discontent. We're no longer playing, like in the
good old days of LamdaMOO and Second Life.
Intuitively, we sense that social media constitute
an arena of struggle where we display our
"experientalism" (James Wallman), where
hierarchy is a given, and profile details such as
gender, race, age, and class are not merely "data"
but decisive measures in the social stratification
ladder.
<br>
<br>
Social media's imaginary community that
we stumble into (and leave behind the moment
we log out) is not fake. The platform is not a
simulacrum of the social. Social media do not
"mask" the real. Neither the software nor the
interface of social media are ironic, multilayered,
or complex. In that sense, social media are no
longer (or not yet) postmodern. The paradoxes at
work here are not playful. The applications do
not appear to us as absurd, let alone Dada. They
are self-evident, functional, even slightly boring.
What attracts us is the social, the never-ending
flow, and not the performativity of the interfaces
themselves. (Performativity seems to be the
main draw of virtual realty, now in its second
hype cycle, twenty-five years after its first).
Networks are not merely arenas of
competition among rival social forces. This is a
far too idealized point of view. If only. What fails
here is the "staging" element. Platforms are not
stages; they bring together and synthesize
(multimedia) data, yes, but what is lacking here
is the (curatorial) element of human labor. That's
why there is no media in social media. The
platforms operate because of their software,
automated procedures, algorithms, and filters,
not because of their large staff of editors and
designers. Their lack of employees is what makes
current debates in terms of racism, anti-
Semitism, and jihadism so timely, as social
media platforms are currently forced by
politicians to employ editors who will have to do
the all-too-human monitoring work (filtering out
ancient ideologies that refuse to disappear).
<br>
<br>
Whereas gadgets such as smartphones and
cameras have a (hyped-up and thus limited)
fetish quality, the social network as such fails to
have such a status. The network has an
ecological status, comparable to Sloterdijk's
theory of the spheres. It surrounds us like air; it's
a Lebenswelt, a (filter) bubble, comparable to the
medieval worldview or imagined Mars colonies.
Today's cosmology consists of layers made of
dating apps, soccer portals, software forums,
and porn sites woven together by search engines,
news sites, and social media. As in the case of
air, it will become quite a task to prove its
existence, but once ideology shows its ugly side,
therapy works through the unconscious,
paradoxes start to fall apart, and the ideology
unravels.
<br>
<br>
Going back to 2004, Wendy Chun was
occupied with the issue of metaphors when
taking software seriously as a new kind of social
realism: "Software and ideology fit each other
perfectly because both try to map the material
effects of the immaterial and to posit the
immaterial through visible cues. Through this
process the immaterial emerges as a commodity,
as something in its own right." The details seem
less interesting to deal with: "Users know very
well that their folders and desktops are not really
folders and desktops, but they treat them as if
they were - by referring to them as folders and
as desktops. This logic is, according to Slavoj
≈Ωi≈æek, crucial to ideology." Is it useful to also note
that the Facebook category of "friends" has
become a similar metaphor. We can surely say
the same of the Facebook "news feed."
<br>
<br>
So, what will happen when the audience
becomes too much to deal with? More important
than deconstructing surface appearances is, in
Chun's words, to argue that "ideology persists in
one's actions rather than in one's beliefs. The
illusion of ideology exists not at the level of
knowledge but rather at the level of doing." Here,
the rhetoric of "interactivity" obfuscates more
than it reveals about the way users negotiate
interfaces; since the computational and control
mechanisms of interfaces are hidden, users
cannot technically "interact" with them directly
enough to understand them. The like economy
"behind" our smart devices is a particularly
relevant social media example. What, for
instance, will happen when we reveal that we
have never believed in our own likes? That we
never liked you in the first place?
<br>
<br>
Let's appraise the bots and the like
economy for what they are: key features of
platform capitalism aimed at capturing value
behind the backs of their users. Social media are
a matter of neither taste nor lifestyle, in the
sense of "consumer choice." They are our
technological mode of the social. In the previous
century we would never have regarded writing
letters or making a telephone call as matters of
taste. They were "cultural techniques," massive
flows of symbolic exchange. Soon after its initial
emergence , social media transformed from a
hype and online service into essential
infrastructure, just like letters and telegrams and
the telephone used to be. It is precisely at this
juncture of "becoming infrastructure" that we
(re)open the ideology file.

 The Young-Girl as technique of the self ----- TIQQUN.
<br>
<br>
 ‚ÄúWhat's ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù?‚Äù
 <br>
 <br>
 Nothing in the Young-Girl's life, even in the remotest parts
 of her private life, escapes alienated reflexivity, codification, and
 the gaze of the Spectacle. This private life, littered with commodities,
 is completely given up to advertising, and completely socialized,
 but socialized as a private life, meaning that it is bit
 by bit subjected to an artificial ordinariness which doesn't allow
 its expression. For the Young-Girl, the most secret is also the most public.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's body encumbers her; it is her world and it is her prison.
 The Young-Girl's physiology is the offensive glacis of her poor substantiality.
 The Young-Girl desires the Young-Girl. The Young-Girl is the Young-Girl's ideal.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúTired of macho-men? Why not give a man-object a try?"
 <br>
 <br>
 The rhetoric of the war of the sexes, and thus - for now -
 the rhetoric of the revenge of women, operates like the final ruse by which masculine logic conquers women without them noticing: by shutting them in, with a simple reversal of roles, to
 alternating between submission/domination, with the exclusion
 of everything else.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúWhat does the mortification of the body require? That
 we harbor a holy and implacable hatred towards our bodies."
 (Spiritual instructions for the sisters of Saint Vincent de Paul,1884)
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl tries to express her self-referential closure in
 upon herself and her systematic ignorance of her unfulfillment.
 That's why she's faultless, and in the same way why she lacks
 any perfection.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the relatively recent prehistory when women's magazines
 were made only for women, a rumour went around for a while that
 they had a depressive effect on their readers. It was said here
 and there - and it was the least of the malicious gossip of that
 time - that there had been an ‚ÄúAmerican scientific study" done
 that said that after a woman put down one of those magazines
 she was noticeably sadder than she had been upon opening it -
 at least she certainly produced less serotonin. And it's true; if
 you've ever seen a young girl engaged in such exercise, you'll
 have noticed that she's got a kind of concerned air about her,
 an anguished seriousness, and a kind of haste to turn the pages,
 as if she were rolling the rosary beads of some sinister religion
 or another. It appears that in the Empire's biopolitical religion,
 the act of contrition has survived just fine, and has only become
 more immanent now.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúIt's my hair and I can do what I want with it!"
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl methodically reinvests everything she's been
 freed from into pure servitude (ask yourself, for example, what
 the modern woman which is a rather terrible kind of Young-Girl,
 has done with the ‚Äúfreedom" that feminism's struggles have won
 for her.)
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is merely an attribute of her own programming,
 where everything must organise itself.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúWhen I was twelve years old I decided to be beautiful."
 <br>
 <br>
 The tautological nature of the Young-Girl's beauty requires
 that no otherness concern her, only its ideal representation.
 Thus to a terrible extent she rejects her allegedly intended recipients,
 no matter how free they are to stupidly believe that she's
 addressing herself to them. The Young-Girl thus sets up such a
 space of her power that in the end there's no way of approaching
 her.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl has a sexuality at all to the exact extent that
 she is foreign to all sensuality.
 <br>
 <br>
 Consequently, the biologisation of the genitals in particular
 and of the body in general sets the body of the young girl up as
 an ideal laboratory for the medical gaze." (Jean-Claude Caron,
 Young Girls' bodies)
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's ‚Äúyouth" and ‚Äúfemininity," her youthitude
 and feminitude in fact, are how appearance control deepens into
 body discipline.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's ass is enough to give her a basis to feel an
 incommunicable singularity.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is such a psychologist . . . She's managed to
 make herself just as at as the object of psychology.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is she whose very being depends on the metaphysical fact of finiteness being reduced to a simple technical question: what's the most effective anti-wrinkle cream?
 <br>
 <br>
 The most touching characteristic of the Young-Girl is doubtless this maniacal effort to attain,
 in appearance, that definitive impermeability to time and space, to her surroundings and history,
 her effort to be impeccable everywhere and at all times.
 The protestant ethic, which has fallen as the general principle
 behind the operation of society and as a behavioural norm upon
 the end of ‚Äúthe morality of labor," has at the same time been
 worked back in entirely on an individual level; this has taken
 place in an accelerated manner since the end of the second world
 war. Now it governs on a mass scale over the relationships that
 people have with their bodies, their passions, their lives - they economise on them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Certainly, because eroticism presents itself to the Young-Girl
 with all the unquestionable positivity inevitably attaching itself
 to sexuality, and because transgression itself has become a calm,
 isolatable and quantified norm, coitus is not one of those things
 that allow any advancement outside of a certain exteriority in the
 relationships one has with the Young-Girl, but on the contrary
 it is one of those things that solidify you within that exteriority.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting new boobs for my 18th birthday.‚Äù
 <br>
 <br>
 The Spectacle's ‚Äúyouth," with which it has gratified the Young-Girl,
 is a very bitter present, since that ‚Äúyouth" is something that is incessantly being lost.
 What's alive doesn't need to ever-increasingly declare itself.
 What's dying shows on its surface that it's coming to an
 end. And the Young-Girl's all-out gender affirmation is a clear
 demonstration of the fact that the classical gender roles are dying,
 meaning that their material basis is dying. The specter of
 Man and Woman haunts the metropolis' streets. Their muscles
 come from the Workout Club and their breasts are silicone.
 There's a window between the Young-Girl and the world.
 Nothing touches the Young-Girl, and the Young-Girl touches
 nothing.
 <br>
 <br>
 nothing about the Young-Girl's identity belongs to her in
 particular, her ‚Äúyouth" even less than her ‚Äúfemininity." it's not
 her that has attributes, but attributes that have her, and that
 is so generously lent to her.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl chases health as if it were a question of safety.
 The feeling of the self as MEAT, as a bunch of organs variously
 decked with ovaries or flanked by nuts, is the basis from
 which begins the aspiration, then the failure of the Young-Girl
 to give herself a form, or at least to simulate having one. This
 feeling is not only a lived consequence of the aberrations of occidental
 metaphysics -which would like the formless to precede
 form, brought to it from outside - it is also what commodity
 domination must perpetuate at all costs; and which it produces
 constantly with the putting of all bodies into equivalence, by the
 denial of forms of life (lifestyles), by the continual exercise of an
 undifferentiating interference. The loss of contact with the self,
 the crushing of all intimacy with the self that gives rise to the
 feeling of yourself as MEAT, gives rise to the sine qua non condition
 for the renewed adoption of the techniques of the self that
 the Empire offers you for consumption. The penetration index
 of all of the cheap commodity crap out there can be read in how
 intensely you feel yourself to be MEAT.
 <br>
 <br>
 The exhausting propriety of bodies
 <br>
 <br>
 Blooms' feeling of contradiction between their existence as
 social beings and their existence as singular beings, which tears
 them apart, does not touch the Young-Girl, who has no more
 singular existence than she does any feelings in general.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúMe and my breasts, my belly-button, my butt, my legs:
 THE MAGAZINE OF MY BODY"
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is her own jailer, the prisoner of a body that
 has become a sign in a language made of bodies.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúOh the cult, the obedience, the servitude of the
 young girl before the image of the school girl and the
 image of the modern girl! . . .Oh the slavery to style
 pushed all the way to self-destruction, oh the docility
 of the young girl! " (Gombrowicz, Ferdydurke )
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúThe deeply rooted instinct among women that urges
 them to use perfumes is the manifestation of a bio-
 logical law. The primary duty of a woman is to be
 attractive . . . It hardly matters how intelligent or in-
 dependent you are; if you can't inuence the men
 that you meet, consciously or not, you won't meet
 your fundamental obligation as a woman . . . " (1920s
 perfume ad from the US)
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl conceives of her own existence as a management
 problem she needs to resolve.
 More than it designates a relationship with others, a social
 relationship, or a form of symbolic integration, the Young-Girl
 designates a relationship with the self, that is, to time.
 Contrary to appearances, the Young-Girl doesn't care about
 herself. She's not an egoist, properly speaking, nor egocentric,
 and that's primarily because her ‚ÄúI‚Äù is actually someone else.
 What she devotes all her care to, with stubborn piety, is in fact
 a reality that is external to her: her ‚Äúbody."
 <br>
 <br>
 The application of the capital-form to everything - capital
 health, capital sun, capital sympathy, etc. - and in a more singular manner to the body,
 means that mediation by the alienated social totality has entered into
 relationships previously ruled by immediacy.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the Young-Girl, the tension between convention and nature is
 apparently absorbed by the annihilation of the meaning
 of those terms, to such an extent that the one never appears to
 do any violence to the other.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is like capitalism, servants, and protozoans:
 she knows how to adapt, and furthermore, she's proud of it.
 <br>
 <br>
 Contrary to what happened in traditional societies, which
 recognised the existence of worthless things and exposed them
 as such, the Young-Girl denies their existence, and hides them.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's appearance is the Young-Girl herself; there's
 nothing in between.
 <br>
 <br>
 Like all slaves, the Young-Girl thinks herself to be much more
 watched than she really is.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's absence from herself is not contradicted by
 any of the ‚Äúcare" she appears to give to herself.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is never as plastic as she'd like to be.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl doesn't like wrinkles, wrinkles don't conform,
 wrinkles are the mark of having lived, life doesn't conform.
 The Young-Girl fears wrinkles as much as she does all true EXPRESSION.
 <br>
 <br>
 As a self-consciousness, the Young-Girl has but a vague feeling of life.
 For the Young-Girl bare life is still a function of habit.
 The Young-Girl lives sequestered in her own ‚Äúbeauty."
 The Young-Girl doesn't love, she loves herself loving.
 ‚ÄúZen, speed, organic: 3 lifestyle systems."
 The Young-Girl doesn't go so far as to demand that the
 fleeting conventions that she subjects herself to have any meaning to
 them.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl understands all relationships on the basis of
 contracts, and more precisely on the basis of revocable contracts
 that can be taken back at any time depending on the interests of
 the contractees. Bargaining on the differential value of each on
 the seduction market where someone's got to reap the dividends
 in the end.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúARE YOU OK WITH YOUR BODY? Are you keeping up
 your young form, with its graceful curves? Is the carpentry solid?
 The clothes silky? Are you doing alright?"
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl daily produces herself as such, by her maniacal reproduction of the dominant ethos.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúHow to gain ten years with a good lifestyle."
 <br>
 <br>
 A cosmetics multinational recently launched an ad-heavy campaign
 for an anti-wrinkle cream called Ethique [ethics]. What
 that meant at the same time is that there's nothing so ethical as
 painting shit all over yourself when you wake up in order to get
 in conformity with the categorical imperative of youthiness, and
 that there could be no other ethos than that of the Young-Girl.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúBeauty" is the mode of disclosure proper to the Young-Girl
 within the Spectacle. That's why she's also a generic product
 that carries within itself all the abstractions of what is found
 in the obligation to address oneself to a certain segment of the
 sexual market in which everything resembles everything else.
 <br>
 <br>
 Capitalism has truly created walth, because it has
 found wealth wher it could not be seen. Thus it
 has for example created beauty, health, or youth as
 riches, that is, as qualities that possess you.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl is never satisfied with her submission to commodity metaphysics,
 with the docility of her whole being, and visibly of her whole body,
 under the Spectacle's norms. That's why she feels the need to show it off.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúThey've wounded me in what is most dear to me:
 my image." (Silvio Berlusconi)
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl always lives in a couple relationship: with
 her image.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl conforms the physiological reach of commodity semiocracy.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúHow beautiful are you? No, beauty isn't a subjective measure.
 As opposed to charm, a rather vague notion, beauty is
 calculated in centimeters, divided into fractions, weighed, examined
 under the magnifying glass, evaluated in a thousand hidden details.
 So stop hiding away behind hippy-cool principles
 like ‚Äúinner beauty, that's what counts," ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my own style,"
 and ‚Äúdare to measure yourself with the greats!"
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's beauty is produced. She herself isn't afraid
 to say: ‚Äúbeauty doesn't fall from the sky," that is, it's the fruit
 of labor.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's self-control and self-constraint are obtained
 by the introjection of two unquestionable ‚Äúnecessities," that of
 reputation and that of health.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúToday, to not suffer isn't a luxury anymore, it's a right."
 <br>
 <br>
 Officially, the Young-Girl would have preferred to become
 some thing that feels rather than some Bloom that suffers.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl pursues plastic perfection in all its forms, notably her own.
 <br>
 <br>
 From body building to anti wrinkle creams by way of liposuction,
 the Young-Girl always has the same dedication to making
 an abstraction of her body, and making her body an abstraction.
 <br>
 <br>
 ‚ÄúAll that can be done to reconcile yourself with your image."
 <br>
 <br>
 Whatever extent her narcissism reaches to, the Young-Girl
 doesn't love herself, what she loves is ‚Äúher" image, that is,
 something that's not just foreign and external, but which, in the full
 sense of the term, possesses her. And the Young-Girl lives
 beneath the tyranny of this ungrateful master.
 The Young-Girl is above all a perspective on the passing of
 time, but a perspective incarnate.
