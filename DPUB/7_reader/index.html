<div class="texttitle">
On The Social Media Ideology. GEERT LOVINK.
</div>

<br>
<br>
Contradictory consciousness-management
has superseded social anxiety about Bad Faith.
This has long been the thesis of Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. <img src="assets/inserts/zizek.png" class="col1of8">
Let's work on this thesis and take seriously the
cynical statement "They know what they do, but
they do it anyway" and apply this to social media. <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8">
There is no longer a need to investigate the
potential of "new media" and deconstruct their
intentions. The internet <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> has reached its
hegemonic stage. In previous decades it was
premature to associate intensive 24/7 usage by
millions with deep structures such as the
(sub)conscious. Now that we live fully in social
media times, it has become pertinent to do
precisely that: link techne with psyche.
<br>
<br>

The revelations of Edward Snowden <img src="assets/inserts/snowden.png" class="col1of8"> arrived
long after our daily surf-and-swap <img src="assets/inserts/surf.png" class="col1of8"> routines had
become firmly entrenched. We know we're
watched by surveillance systems <img src="assets/inserts/surveillance.png" class="col1of8"> but who can
honesty claim to constantly be aware of them?
Artistic masks <img src="assets/inserts/mask.png" class="col1of8"> are promoted as protective face
shields yet who wears them? The internet may
be broken, <img src="assets/inserts/broken.png" class="col1of8"> as the phrase goes (and IT engineers
have reached a consensus about this troubling
analysis), but this cannot be said of social
media. Like Snowden's revelations, Sherry
Turkle's <img src="assets/inserts/turkle.png" class="col1of8"> evidence about smartphones inhibiting
one's empathy and ability to enjoy the virtues of
solitude have arrived late in the social media
game. How hard has it become to confront
offline boredom? <img src="assets/inserts/boredom.png" class="col1of8"> It's a straight-up torture.
<br>
<br>
The slogan "You are what you share" (Charles Leadbeater) expresses the
transformation of the autonomous unit of the
self into an outgoing entity that is constantly
reproducing its social capital through the
transmission of value (data) to others. Let's face
it: we refuse to perceive ourselves as "slaves of
the machine." <img src="assets/inserts/slavetothemachine.png" class="col1of8"> What does it mean when we all
agree that there is an addictive element to
today's social media use, yet none of us is
apparently addicted? <img src="assets/inserts/addiction.png" class="col1of8"> Are we really returning only
sporadically? What exactly is being captured
here? If anything, we're encapsulated by the
social sphere <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> as such, not by the software, nor by
the protocols, network architectures, or the
assuredly infantile interfaces.
<br>
<br>
Under this spell of desire for the social, led
by the views and opinions of our immediate
social circle <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8">, our daily routines are as follows:
view recent stories first, fine-tune filter
preferences, <img src="assets/inserts/lady.png" class="col1of8"> jump to first unread, update your
life with events, clear and refresh all, not now,
save links to read for later, <img src="assets/inserts/woman.png" class="col1of8"> see full conversation,
mute your ex, set up a secret board, run a poll,
comment <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8"> through the social plug-in, add video to
your profile, choose between love, <img src="assets/inserts/love.png" class="col1of8"> haha,<img src="assets/inserts/haha.png" class="col1of8"> wow, <img src="assets/inserts/wow.png" class="col1of8">
sad, and angry, engage with those who mention
you while tracking the changes in relationship
status of others, follow a key opinion leader,
receive notifications, create a photo spread that
links to your avatar, repost a photo, get lost in the
double-barrel river of your timeline, prevent
friends <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8"> from seeing updates, check out
something based on a recommendation,
customize cover images, create 'must-click'
headlines, chat <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">with a friend while noticing that
1,326,595 people like this topic. <img src="assets/inserts/wow.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>

Social networking <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> is much more than just a
dominant discourse. We need to go beyond text
and images and include its software, interfaces,
and networks that depend on a technical
infrastructure consisting of offices and their
consultants and cleaners, cables and data
centers, working in close concert with the
movements and habits of the connected billions.
Academic internet studies circles have shifted
their attention from utopian promises, impulses,
and critiques to "mapping" the network's impact.
<br>
<br>

From digital humanities to data science we see a
shift in network-oriented inquiry from Whether
and Why, What and Who, to (merely) How. From a
sociality of causes to a sociality of net effects. A
new generation of humanistic researchers is
lured into the "big data" trap, <img src="assets/inserts/mark.png" class="col1of8"> and kept busy
capturing user behavior whilst producing
seductive eye candy for an image-hungry <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8">
audience (and vice versa).
<br>
<br>
Without noticing, we have arrived at a new,
yet unnamed, stage: the hegemonic era of social
media platforms as ideology. <img src="assets/inserts/lightbulb.png" class="col1of8"> Products and
services are of course usually subject to
ideology. We have learned to "read"  <img src="assets/inserts/read.png" class="col1of8">ideology into
them. But at what point can we convincingly say
they have become ideology themselves? It is one
thing to state that Mark Zuckerberg <img src="assets/inserts/mark.png" class="col1of8"> (founder of
Facebook) is an ideologue, working in the service
of US intelligence agencies, or to document
community or political groups using his social
media platform in ways unplanned or counter to
expectations inherent to its design. It is quite
another to work on a comprehensive social
media  <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8">theory. It is a crucial time for critical
theory to reclaim lost territory and bring on
exactly this: a shift from the quantitative to the
qualitative, uncomputable impacts of this
ubiquitous formatting of the social. It is
liberating for research to sever itself from the
instrumental approach of (viral) marketing and
public relations. Stop pushing, start analyzing. <img src="assets/inserts/lightbulb.png" class="col1of8">
Network technologies are rapidly becoming the
"new normal," withdrawing their operations and
governance from view. We need to politicize the
New Electricity, the privately owned utilities of
our century, before they disappear into the
background.
<br>
<br>
The 2008 chapter of internet criticism is
coming to a close. <img src="assets/inserts/closed.png" class="col1of8">For the next round of The
Critique of the Political Economy, the internet
and digital technologies will have to be fully
integrated. The easy opposition of California
utopians <img src="assets/inserts/sun.png" class="col1of8"> vs. Euro pessimists <img src="assets/inserts/cloud.png" class="col1of8"> has been
superseded by much larger planetary issues
such as the future of work. We need to take
internet critique beyond the normative regulation
of behavior and politicize the anxiety of the youth <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8">
and their particular addictions and distractions.
We have long come to terms with the actual and
virtual nature of the social, as its potential for
play and manipulation seems increasingly in
abeyance. Social media <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8"> demand from us that we
perform in a never-ending show. <img src="assets/inserts/circus.png" class="col1of8"> We keep coming
back, always remaining logged in, until the
#DigitalDetox <img src="assets/inserts/juice.png" class="col1of8"> sets in and we're called to
different realms.
<br>
<br>
The social, political, and economic promise
of the internet <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> as a decentralized network of
networks lies in tatters. Social media
alternatives, five years after their initial
appearance, haven't made much progress at all.
Despite all well-intended critical predictions, the
herds have not moved on to greener <img src="assets/inserts/juice.png" class="col1of8"> pastures.
The overall picture is one of stagnation in a field
defined by the corporate domination of a handful
of players. We all remain stuck in the social
media mud, <img src="assets/inserts/mud.png" class="col1of8"> and it's time to ask why. Comparable
to the late-1970s stagnation in mainstream
media critique, a political economy approach will
not be sufficient if we want to come up with
workable strategies. One possible way out could
be a post-Freudian <img src="assets/inserts/freud.png" class="col1of8"> answer to the question:
What's on a User's Mind? We need to answer the
question as to what social media actually offer.
Which desires do they appeal to? Why is updating
such a seductive yet boring habit? <img src="assets/inserts/refresh.png" class="col1of8"> Can we
develop a set of critical concepts that would
describe our compulsive attraction to social
media, without reducing that attraction to
addiction rhetoric? <img src="assets/inserts/hmm.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>
A starting point for reading social media as
ideology would be Wendy Chun's <img src="assets/inserts/chun.png" class="col1of8"> 2004 essay on
the idea of "software" as ideology. Chun's work,
along with the work of Jodi Dean <img src="assets/inserts/dean.png" class="col1of8"> and others,
speaks strongly to the media theorist coming to
terms with the peak of neoliberal transition and
the triumph of proprietary software. The
prominence of ideology as a central term in
debates has faded away since the mid-1980s.
The backdrop of ideology theory in the 1970s was
the spectacular peaking of the power of the state
apparatus (also called the welfare state) that
was commissioned to administrate the postwar
class compromise. Whilst Daniel Bell's End of
Ideology, as announced in 1960, had arrived with
the victory of neoliberalism at the end of the Cold
War, there was an intuitive feeling that ideology -
with a small i - had not yet left the stage, and the
World Without Ideas was not yet within reach,
despite concerted efforts to diminish the role of
public intellectuals and critical discourses.
<br>
<br>
The "Californian ideology" <img src="assets/inserts/sun.png" class="col1of8">as defined in
1995 by Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron
helped us trace the motives underlying the
internet back to their Cold War <img src="assets/inserts/fire.png" class="col1of8"> roots (and the
ambivalent hippie culture). <img src="assets/inserts/hippy.png" class="col1of8"> Fred Turner's 2006
classic From Counterculture to Cyberculture did
much the same. But the historical perspective is
not much use if it cannot explain social media's <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8">
contemporary and persistent success since the
1990s. Now, as in the 1970s, <img src="assets/inserts/hippy.png" class="col1of8"> the role of ideology
in navigating the limits of existing systems is all
too real. To study ideology is to take a close look
at this everyday life, here and now. What remains
particularly unexplained is the apparent paradox
between the hyper-individualized subject and
the herd mentality of the social. <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> What's wrong
with the social? What's right with it? Positivity is
as pervasive in California <img src="assets/inserts/sun.png" class="col1of8"> as it is in the Italian <img src="assets/inserts/italy.png" class="col1of8">
cyberspace scene, which, in a Gramscian move,
has embraced the "social network" as a sign
within popular culture <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">that the multitude can
beat the mainstream in its act of mediation.
Italian <img src="assets/inserts/italy.png" class="col1of8">critics, activists, and artists are not unlike
many others in being hyperaware of all the
controversies that surround the products and
services made in Silicon Valley, <img src="assets/inserts/slavetothemachine.png" class="col1of8"> while remaining
mostly positive about the magic potion <img src="assets/inserts/potion.png" class="col1of8"> called
social networking.
<br>
<br>
One function of ideology as defined by Louis
Althusser <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8"> is recognition, the (in)famous
interpellation of the subject that is being called
upon. We can apply this and speak of the
process of becoming-user. This is the unnoticed
part of the social media saga. Before we enter
the social media sphere, <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> everyone first fills out a
profile and choses a username and password <img src="assets/inserts/lock.png" class="col1of8"> in
order to create an account. Minutes later, you're
part of the game  <img src="assets/inserts/game.png" class="col1of8">and you start sharing, creating,
playing, as if it has always been like that. The
profile is the a priori part and the profiling and
targeted advertising cannot operate without it.
The platforms present themselves as self-evident.
They just are - facilitating our feature-rich lives.
Everyone that counts is there. <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8"> It is
through the gate of the profile that we become
its subject.
<br>
<br>
For Althusser, <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8"> we live inside ideology in this
way - the formula applies in particular to social
media in which subjects are addressed as users
who do not exist without a profile. <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8"> It is justified
to use this slightly authoritarian, hermetic
concept of ideology because of the highly
centralized top-down structure of social media
architecture in this age of platform capitalism,
which leaves zero space for users to reprogram
their communication spaces. <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>
Despite all the postmodernism and cynical
neoliberalism that has deemed it redundant, it is
no surprise that ideology (again) rules.<img src="assets/inserts/hmm.png" class="col1of8"> (It is more
remarkable how total the concept's fall from use
has been.) The main issue is that we are less and
less aware of how it rules. When it comes to
social media <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> we have an "enlightened false
consciousness" <img src="assets/inserts/slavetothemachine.png" class="col1of8">in which we know very well what
we are doing when we are fully sucked in, but we
do it anyway. This even accounts at a meta-level
for the popularity of ≈Ωi≈æek's <img src="assets/inserts/zizek.png" class="col1of8"> insights - and could
be one of the best explanations for his success.
We're all aware of the algorithmic manipulations
of Facebook's news feed, the filter-bubble effect
in apps, and the persuasive presence of
personalized advertisement. We pull in updates,
24/7, in a real-time global economy of
interdependencies, having been taught to read
news feeds as interpersonal indicators of the
planetary condition. So in what way does Louis
Althusser <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8"> need updating?
<br>
<br>
Four decades after the Althusser <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8"> era, we do
not associate ideology with the state in the same way
he and his followers did. To qualify Facebook <img src="assets/inserts/mark.png" class="col1of8">
and Google as falling within the Althusserian
definition of "ideological state apparatus"
sounds odd, if not exotic. In this era of late
neoliberalism and right-wing populism, ideology
is associated with the market, not with the state,
which has withdrawn into the role of merely
securing the market. But lest we forget, it was
ideology theory itself that contributed to the
"crisis of marxism."  <img src="assets/inserts/fire.png" class="col1of8"> It led the way in opening up
marxism to issues thrust to the fore by the
student movement, the rise of feminism, and
other "new social movements," and also
highlighted the stagnation and bankruptcy <img src="assets/inserts/lock.png" class="col1of8"> of the
Soviet Union. The growing interest in media and
"cultural studies" did the rest.
<br>
<br>
Treating social media as ideology <img src="assets/inserts/ideology.png" class="col1of8"> means
observing how it binds together media, <img src="assets/inserts/refresh.png" class="col1of8"> culture, <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">
and identity <img src="assets/inserts/mask.png" class="col1of8"> into an ever-growing cultural
performance (and related "cultural studies") of
gender, lifestyle, fashion, brands, celebrity, and
news from radio, television, magazines, and the
web - all of this imbricated with the
entrepreneurial values of venture capital and
start-up culture, with their underside of
declining livelihoods and growing inequality. <img src="assets/inserts/lady.png" class="col1of8">
Every user has their confession: "It's definitely
harder to avoid social media <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8"> than it is to give into
it. Most people tend to give into it, because its
easier". <img src="assets/inserts/slavetothemachine.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>
Wendy Chun <img src="assets/inserts/chun.png" class="col1of8"> wrote her 2004 essay on
software as ideology <img src="assets/inserts/ideology.png" class="col1of8"> in the golden 2.0 era of the
web, when software was coming to be
considered synonymous with - and confused
with - PCs and laptops. <img src="assets/inserts/lady.png" class="col1of8"> She wrote: "Software is
a functional analogue to ideology. In a formal
sense computers understood as comprising
software and hardware are ideology machines."
She noted that software "fulfills almost every
formal definition of ideology we have, from
ideology as false consciousness to Louis
Althusser's  <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8"> definition of ideology as a
representation' of the imaginary relation of
individuals to their real conditions of existence.'"
In an age of installed, micro-perceptual effects
and streamed programming, ideology does not
merely refer to an abstract sphere <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> where the
battle of ideas is being fought. Think more in line
with a Spinozan sense of embodiment - from the
repetitive strains of Tinder swiping, <img src="assets/inserts/woman.png" class="col1of8"> to text neck, <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8">
to the hunched-over-laptop syndrome. <img src="assets/inserts/read.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>
What is crusted as orthodoxy in Althusser <img src="assets/inserts/althusser.png" class="col1of8">
needs some adaptation and updating, not only in
terms of a class analysis. But it is still
remarkable how smoothly an Althusserian
ideology framework fits today's world, as Chun <img src="assets/inserts/chun.png" class="col1of8">
proves:
Software, or perhaps more precisely
operating systems, offer us an imaginary
relationship to our hardware: they do not
represent transistors but rather desktops and
recycling bins. Software produces users. Without
operating system (OS) there would be no access
to hardware; without OS no actions, no practices,
and thus no user. Each OS, through its
advertisements, interpellates a "user": calls it
and offers it a name or image with which to
identify. <img src="assets/inserts/mask.png" class="col1of8">
<br>
<br>
We could say that social media performs
the same function, and is even more powerful.
"What are you doing?" said Twitter's original
phrase. The question marks the material roots of
social media. Social media platforms have never
asked "What are you thinking?" <img src="assets/inserts/hmm.png" class="col1of8"> Or dreaming, for
that matter. Twentieth-century libraries are full
of novels, diaries, comic strips, and films in
which people expressed what are were thinking.
In the age of social media we seem to confess
less what we think. <img src="assets/inserts/chat.png" class="col1of8">It's considered too risky, too
private. We share what we do, and see, in a
staged manner. Yes, we share judgments and
opinions, but no thoughts. Our Self is too busy for
that, always on the move, flexible, open, sporty,
sexy, and always ready to connect and express.
With 24/7 social visibility, <img src="assets/inserts/closed.png" class="col1of8"> apparatus and
application become one in the body. This is a
reversal of Marshall McLuhan's Extensions of
Man - we are now witnessing an Inversion of
Man. Once technology entangles our senses and
gets under our skin, distance collapses and we
no longer have any sense that we are bridging
distances. With Jean Baudrillard we could speak
of an implosion of the social into the hand-held
device in which an unprecedented accumulation
of storage capacity, computational power,
software, and social capital is crystallized.
Things get right in our face, our ears, steered by
our autonomous finger tips. This is what Michel
Serres admires so much in the navigational
plasticity of the mobile generation, the
smoothness of its gestures, symbolized in the
speed of the thumb, sending updates in seconds,
mastering mini-conversations, grasping the
mood of a global tribe in an instant. To stay
within the French realm of references: social
media <img src="assets/inserts/socialsphere.png" class="col1of8"> as the apparatus of sexy and sporty
"active acting" makes it a perfect vehicle for the
literature of despair epitomized by Michel
Houellebecq's messy body(-politics).
<br>
<br>
Social media's imaginary community that
we stumble into (and leave behind the moment
we log out) is not fake. <img src="assets/inserts/lightbulb.png" class="col1of8"> The platform is not a
simulacrum of the social. Social media do not
"mask" <img src="assets/inserts/mask.png" class="col1of8">the real. Neither the software nor the
interface of social media are ironic, multilayered,
or complex. In that sense, social media are no
longer (or not yet) postmodern. The paradoxes at
work here are not playful. The applications do
not appear to us as absurd, let alone Dada. They
are self-evident, functional, even slightly boring. <img src="assets/inserts/boredom.png" class="col1of8">
What attracts us is the social, the never-ending
flow, and not the performativity of the interfaces
themselves. (Performativity seems to be the
main draw of virtual realty, now in its second
hype cycle, twenty-five years after its first).
Networks <img src="assets/inserts/share.png" class="col1of8"> are not merely arenas of
competition among rival social forces. This is a
far too idealized point of view. If only. What fails
here is the "staging" element. Platforms are not
stages; they bring together and synthesize
(multimedia) data, yes, but what is lacking here
is the (curatorial) element of human labor. That's
why there is no media in social media. The
platforms operate because of their software,
automated procedures, algorithms, and filters,
not because of their large staff of editors and
designers. <img src="assets/inserts/addiction.png" class="col1of8"> Their lack of employees is what makes
current debates in terms of racism, anti-
Semitism, and jihadism so timely, as social
media platforms are currently forced by
politicians to employ editors who will have to do
the all-too-human monitoring work (filtering out

<br>
<br>
Whereas gadgets such as smartphones <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8"> and
cameras have a (hyped-up and thus limited)
fetish quality, the social network as such fails to
have such a status. The network has an
ecological status, comparable to Sloterdijk's
theory of the spheres. It surrounds us like air; <img src="assets/inserts/cloud.png" class="col1of8">it's
a Lebenswelt, a (filter) bubble, comparable to the
medieval worldview or imagined Mars colonies.
Today's cosmology consists of layers made of
dating apps, <img src="assets/inserts/love.png" class="col1of8"> soccer portals, software forums,
and porn sites woven together by search engines,
news sites, <img src="assets/inserts/wow.png" class="col1of8"> and social media. As in the case of
air, it will become quite a task to prove its
existence, but once ideology shows its ugly side,
therapy works through the unconscious,
paradoxes start to fall apart, and the ideology
unravels.
<br>
<br>
Going back to 2004, Wendy Chun <img src="assets/inserts/chun.png" class="col1of8">was
occupied with the issue of metaphors when
taking software seriously as a new kind of social
realism: "Software and ideology <img src="assets/inserts/ideology.png" class="col1of8"> fit each other
perfectly because both try to map the material
effects of the immaterial and to posit the
immaterial through visible cues. Through this
process the immaterial emerges as a commodity,
as something in its own right." The details seem
less interesting to deal with: "Users know very
well that their folders and desktops are not really
folders and desktops, but they treat them as if
they were - by referring to them as folders and
as desktops. This logic is, according to Slavoj
≈Ωi≈æek, <img src="assets/inserts/zizek.png" class="col1of8"> crucial to ideology." Is it useful to also note
that the Facebook category of "friends" <img src="assets/inserts/friends.png" class="col1of8"> has
become a similar metaphor. We can surely say
the same of the Facebook "news feed."
<br>
<br>
So, what will happen when the audience <img src="assets/inserts/mark.png" class="col1of8">
becomes too much to deal with? More important
than deconstructing surface appearances is, in
Chun's <img src="assets/inserts/chun.png" class="col1of8"> words, to argue that "ideology persists in
one's actions rather than in one's beliefs. The
illusion of ideology exists not at the level of
knowledge but rather at the level of doing." Here,
the rhetoric of "interactivity" obfuscates more
than it reveals about the way users negotiate
interfaces; since the computational and control
mechanisms of interfaces are hidden, users
cannot technically "interact" with them directly
enough to understand them. The like economy
"behind" our smart devices <img src="assets/inserts/smartphone.png" class="col1of8"> is a particularly
relevant social media example. What, for
instance, will happen when we reveal that we
have never believed in our own likes? <img src="assets/inserts/love.png" class="col1of8"> That we

 Nothing in the Young-Girl's life, even in the remotest parts
 of her private life, escapes alienated reflexivity, codification, and
 the gaze of the Spectacle. This private life, littered with commodities,
 is completely given up to advertising, and completely socialized,
 but socialized as a private life, meaning that it is bit
 by bit subjected to an artificial ordinariness which doesn't allow
 its expression. For the Young-Girl, the most secret is also the most public.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's body encumbers her; it is her world and it is her prison.
 The Young-Girl's physiology is the offensive glacis of her poor substantiality.

 The rhetoric of the war of the sexes, and thus - for now -
 the rhetoric of the revenge of women, operates like thefinal ruse by which masculine logic conquers women without them noticing: by shutting them in, with a simple reversal of roles, to
 alternating between submission/domination, with the exclusion
 of everything else.

 The Young-Girl tries to express her self-referential closure in
 upon herself and her systematic ignorance of her unfulfillment.
 That's why she's faultless, and in the same way why she lacks
 any perfection.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the relatively recent prehistory when women's magazines
 were made only for women, a rumour went around for a while that
 they had a depressive effect on their readers. It was said here
 and there - and it was the least of the malicious gossip of that
 time - that there had been an ‚ÄúAmerican scientific study" done
 that said that after a woman put down one of those magazines
 she was noticeably sadder than she had been upon opening it -
 at least she certainly produced less serotonin. And it's true; if
 you've ever seen a young girl engaged in such exercise, you'll
 have noticed that she's got a kind of concerned air about her,
 an anguished seriousness, and a kind of haste to turn the pages,
 as if she were rolling the rosary beads of some sinister religion
 or another. It appears that in the Empire's biopolitical religion,
 the act of contrition has survived just fine, and has only become
 more immanent now.

 no matter how free they are to stupidly believe that she's
 addressing herself to them. The Young-Girl thus sets up such a
 space of her power that in the end there's no way of approaching
 her.

 The Young-Girl has a sexuality at all to the exact extent that
 she is foreign to all sensuality.

 The Young-Girl's ‚Äúyouth" and ‚Äúfemininity," her youthitude
 and feminitude in fact, are how appearance control deepens into
 body discipline.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl's ass is enough to give her a basis to feel an
 incommunicable singularity.
 <br>

 The Young-Girl is such a psychologist . . . She's managed to

 The Young-Girl is she whose very being depends on the metaphysical fact offiniteness being reduced to a simple technical question: what's the most effective anti-wrinkle cream?
 <br>
 <br>
 The most touching characteristic of the Young-Girl is doubtless this maniacal effort to attain,
 in appearance, that definitive impermeability to time and space, to her surroundings and history,
 her effort to be impeccable everywhere and at all times.
 The protestant ethic, which has fallen as the general principle
 behind the operation of society and as a behavioural norm upon
 the end of ‚Äúthe morality of labor," has at the same time been
 worked back in entirely on an individual level; this has taken
 place in an accelerated manner since the end of the second world
 war. Now it governs on a mass scale over the relationships that
 people have with their bodies, their passions, their lives - they economise on them.
 <br>
 <br>
 Certainly, because eroticism presents itself to the Young-Girl
 with all the unquestionable positivity inevitably attaching itself
 to sexuality, and because transgression itself has become a calm,
 isolatable and quantified norm, coitus is not one of those things
 that allow any advancement outside of a certain exteriority in the
 relationships one has with the Young-Girl, but on the contrary
 it is one of those things that solidify you within that exteriority.

 The Spectacle's ‚Äúyouth," with which it has gratified the Young-Girl,
 is a very bitter present, since that ‚Äúyouth" is something that is incessantly being lost.
 What's alive doesn't need to ever-increasingly declare itself.
 What's dying shows on its surface that it's coming to an
 end. And the Young-Girl's all-out gender affirmation is a clear
 demonstration of the fact that the classical gender roles are dying,
 meaning that their material basis is dying. The specter of
 Man and Woman haunts the metropolis' streets. Their muscles
 come from the Workout Club and their breasts are silicone.
 There's a window between the Young-Girl and the world.
 Nothing touches the Young-Girl, and the Young-Girl touches
 nothing.
 <br>
 <br>
 nothing about the Young-Girl's identity belongs to her in
 particular, her ‚Äúyouth" even less than her ‚Äúfemininity." it's not
 her that has attributes, but attributes that have her, and that
 is so generously lent to her.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl chases health as if it were a question of safety.
 The feeling of the self as MEAT, as a bunch of organs variously
 decked with ovaries or flanked by nuts, is the basis from
 which begins the aspiration, then the failure of the Young-Girl
 to give herself a form, or at least to simulate having one. This
 feeling is not only a lived consequence of the aberrations of occidental
 metaphysics -which would like the formless to precede
 form, brought to it from outside - it is also what commodity
 domination must perpetuate at all costs; and which it produces
 constantly with the putting of all bodies into equivalence, by the
 denial of forms of life (lifestyles), by the continual exercise of an
 undifferentiating interference. The loss of contact with the self,
 the crushing of all intimacy with the self that gives rise to the
 feeling of yourself as MEAT, gives rise to the sine qua non condition
 for the renewed adoption of the techniques of the self that
 the Empire offers you for consumption. The penetration index
 of all of the cheap commodity crap out there can be read in how
 intensely you feel yourself to be MEAT.

 <br>
 ‚ÄúThe deeply rooted instinct among women that urges
 them to use perfumes is the manifestation of a bio-
 logical law. The primary duty of a woman is to be

 that you meet, consciously or not, you won't meet
 your fundamental obligation as a woman . . . " (1920s

 <br>
 <br>
 The Young-Girl conceives of her own existence as a management
 problem she needs to resolve.
 More than it designates a relationship with others, a social
 relationship, or a form of symbolic integration, the Young-Girl
 designates a relationship with the self, that is, to time.
 Contrary to appearances, the Young-Girl doesn't care about
 herself. She's not an egoist, properly speaking, nor egocentric,
 and that's primarily because her ‚ÄúI‚Äù is actually someone else.
 What she devotes all her care to, with stubborn piety, is in fact
 a reality that is external to her: her ‚Äúbody."

 <br>
 The application of the capital-form to everything - capital
 health, capital sun, capital sympathy, etc. - and in a more singular manner to the body,
 means that mediation by the alienated social totality has entered into
 relationships previously ruled by immediacy.

 In the Young-Girl, the tension between convention and nature is
 apparently absorbed by the annihilation of the meaning
 of those terms, to such an extent that the one never appears to
 do any violence to the other.

Love Machines and the Tinder Bot Bildungsroman. LEE MACKINNON.
</div>

<br>
<br>
Generally, I do not write autobiography,
especially on the subject of love, but in this case
I will make a small exception. One Sunday, early
last year, my boyfriend called from his mobile
telephone. He had recently returned from Berlin
and we were chatting quite generally when
suddenly the conversation became strained and
he announced that our relationship was over. Two
days later, a packet was delivered to my house
from Berlin. Inside was a small hand-carved deer
from the Black Forest that was missing one leg;
another had recently been repaired. A
handwritten note from the same man
accompanied the damaged deer. Evidently he
had sent the package before the relationship's
recent and abrupt ending.
<br>
<br>
The story now developed two temporal
dimensions: one proper to the mobile digital
device, so prone to the fickle algorithms of its
human user; the other embodied in the package
delivered by post, whose passage had unfolded
across space and time, oblivious to the closure of
the place it was intended to hold. This series of
events struck me as a poignant expression of two
different technical systems of communication
and their ability to execute our decisions. The
older of these is a calculative regime: analog,
probabilistic, and determining. The second is a
computational regime, where temporal and
spatial relations are expedited by digital
processing, and these express contingency. I
photographed the hand-carved deer and the
handwritten note with my smartphone, using the
same device to preserve the very tenderness it
had cut short two days earlier.
<br>
<br>
I have elsewhere considered love from the
point of view of two technical systems of delivery
and distribution that reflect this split between a
temporal, calculable, analog discourse, and an
ultra-rapid, digital, and computational one.
Friedrich Kittler might refer to these as discrete
discourse machines , considered according to the
technical devices and systems of communication
they deploy. We can differentiate between a
literary (predigital) and a computational
(postdigital) discourse machine. Both participate
in distributing love's codes and behaviors
through social systems. In the literary (often
epistolary) system of predigital romantic
narrative, longing and "repining from afar" were
techniques of romantic calculation that testified
to the resolve of the beloved in remaining true.
 "How I envy Valmont!" Laclos has the young
Chevalier Danceny write in a letter to his beloved
in Dangerous Liaisons . "It is he who will deliver
this letter to you, while I, repining from afar, drag
out my painful existence in longing and misery."
 The love letter implies the separation of the lover
and the beloved. Enduring the pain of this
separation would guarantee the truth of a given instance of love.
<br>
<br>
Romantic fiction distributed
such romantic codes, promoting an idea that
these referred to a natural state that precedes
the thoughts that they, in fact, facilitate. In its
definition of the true , the literary discourse
machine relies on a wholly calculable logic and
the continuity of the subject and their sentiment.
"How do I love thee?" asks the poet. "Let me
count the ways."  This logic of probabilistic
calculation is a feature of the literary regime of
love. Love and the lover must be continuous
across space and time in order to demonstrate
that they and their love remain true. Ironically,
the importance of calculability in literary
romantic truth is most evident in its desire to
appear incalculable. In other words, truth, love,
the subject, and even narrativity must
demonstrate a disassociation from the very
calculability whose standard it nevertheless
accepts. Chevalier Danceny claims that only a
"vile seductor can suit his plans to
circumstances and calculate according to
events; but the love which animates me permits
me only two sentiments - courage and
constancy."  Calculability is considered in terms
of utility and deception, while love is the realm of
ineffable incalculability that equates with
constancy.
<br>
<br>
By way of devices such as the novel, the
behaviours and thoughts associated with modern
romantic love - longing; feverishness; obsession
and the gendered overtures of seduction -
become "felt" as elements of a natural condition,
rather than understood as the result of a
technical arrangement. This encoding takes
place through machines of discourse. Speaking
of Germany in the 1800s, Kittler argues that
women in particular are beings indoctrinated
into the naturalized  power structures of love, in
this case by way of poetry anthologies:
The anthology was invented as a didactic
tool circa 1800. The "historical background"
of "this didactic development," however,
can only be attributed to the "the rise of
capitalist mass production" insofar as
Poetry itself became alphabetically
reproducible. Poetry anthologies only
repeated, in the repeatability of an
institution, the new school, the command
repeatedly to "read Goethe and always
Goethe," which Brentano gave to his sister.
Women, instead of "eternally repeating
what is already the case," which is called
love, took their oaths by reading and
rereading the German classics in secondary
schools for girls. This was the reason for
establishing the German classics.
<br>
<br>
Kittler highlights the fact that romantic love was
entirely cultural and calculable rather than
natural and incalculable. Its appropriate codes
were imbibed by recitation, which was also
internalization. Subsequently, in the generalized
literary discourse machine of the nineteenth
century, love and woman become seemingly
natural conditions that are synonymous figures
of literature and foreground the male author and
protagonist as figures and purveyors of culture.
Women, love, and nature no longer speak for
themselves, but are the naturalized, and natural ,
concepts of male authorial contemplation. In
this case, far from being natural or a priori, love
only takes place via the media technologies that
distribute its idea. By insisting on the agency of
machines and the cultural quality of love, Kittler
dispels the received understanding of love as
something that takes place separately from
technical systems. Instead, technical systems
are integrated into its condition. "As we are all
painfully aware in 1999," he writes, "there are of
course media technologies without love, but
there is no love without media technologies."
In Niklas Luhmann's analysis of literary
technology, the chance encounter is deployed as
love's prelude, subsequently democratizing love
throughout the social system. The couple
performs a calculation of chance, and more
particularly, becomes a probability. Indeed, in
typical narrative structures, whether love is
"true" is something that the author always knows
better than anyone, and in advance and in this
way, narrative can similarly be considered as a
function of probability. We have already noted
that literature implicitly restratifies and
naturalizes power structures, such as gendered
identities, that seem to be not only natural but,
according to Luhmann, also democratic. With the
novel came a new reflexive interiority through
which the reader could internalize and preempt
the other, providing a coda for the management
of passion. Thus the difference between true and
feigned emotion in love becomes "one between
love, on the one hand, and on the other, the
discourse on love between lovers and the
novelist who always know in advance the way
things should really be."
<br>
<br>
In summary, love's contingent features and
its relation to chance are highlighted by the
discourse machine of fiction that attempts to
embed its lessons as features of natural
conduct. Calculation is the technique through
which love comes to assert its function as a
determination in an increasingly secular, chaotic
world, as Luhmann would suggest. Love in the
literary discourse machine is thus expressive of
contingency, probability, and calculation.
Yet love will be considered differently,
depending which discourse machine facilitates
it.
<br>
<br>
While love in the literary discourse machine
referred to by Luhmann and Kittler can be
considered a calculation of chance , in the digital
computational discourse machine that succeeds
it, love is rather a computation  that highlights the
limitations and contingency of probabilistic
calculation. If predigital forms of love are
dominated by the calculation and the co-
determination of the couple, postdigital,
algorithmic systems of accelerating
computability make love less, rather than more,
deterministic, even though dating websites are
keen to convince us otherwise. In the volumes of
sites, potential partners, and proclamations of
others who claim to be "looking for love," we see
a general acceleration of contingency. Love no
longer functions to deliver us from chance and
into the relative security of probability, but rather
into accelerating indeterminacy. Love and
intimacy no longer function to shield us from the
"immense complexity and contingency of all the
things, which could be deemed possible," but
facilitate increasing access to complexity,
contingency, and possibility. In an online
context, love comes to be defined by novelty,
differentiation, and incomputability.
The notion of remaining true is understood
differently from within each of the discourse
machines. In the postdigital era of ubiquitous
computation, this refers to incomputable data
which, while being true,  is not logically
expressible. G.del's theory of incompleteness
states that reason is not limited to calculability.
Incompleteness can be expressed in simple
linguistic terms by the liar's paradox, which
consists in uttering, "This statement is not true."
Neither true nor false points of formula can be
derived. Such logic anticipates Alan Turing's
problem of incomputability, which has been
understood to describe the condition of
mathematical reason as irreducibly complex.
Turing's theory of incomputability suggested
that there was no way of knowing whether a
computer program commanded to "run" would
ever come to a halt. He named this the "halting
function," a problem that has yet to be resolved.
Gregory Chaitin claims that it is not possible to
demonstrate that any computer program chosen
at random will ever halt; no algorithm or
mathematical theory could ever calculate this
potential, unless it were a value less than 0 and
more than 1. Chaitin names such a hypothetical
value "omega" - a well-defined number that
cannot be computed in its entirety. He takes
this as evidence that calculability always
contains an irreducible uncertainty. In this case,
we see that while computation is often aligned
with expedience, convenience, and
hyperrationality, it can also be considered as
deeply complex, alluding to new forms of logic
associated with undecidability, incompletion,
and the incomputable. The true, while being
contingent and incompressible, is true
nevertheless. Thus the calculability of relative
truth that we assumed in the predigital discourse
machine cannot be assumed in the postdigital
one. We will see that such uncertainty extends to
subjects and understandings of narrative and
agency more generally.
<br>
<br>
Of course, as with the mobile phone
photographing the love letter, pre- and
postdigital modes of discourse and their
characteristics operate simultaneously: one
continues its narrative trajectory; the other edits
together two seemingly unconnected states
using an iPhone to enact the jump cut common
to both the cinematic and hypertextual methods
of assemblage. We can see the cinematic cut as
a predecessor of the hypertextual click and a key
step in the evolution of media toward increasing
participation. I was reminded, via the immediacy
of my cell phone's real-time edit, of the choose-
your-own-adventure gamebooks of my
childhood, where simply selecting one page over
another could mean the difference between life
and death. These gamebooks were the
harbingers of hypertext and digital space,
investing the linear form of the book with a new
agency, an act comparable to Atari's
transformation of the previously passive
television set with the release of Pong , its first
video game. The gamebook highlighted the
passivity of typical narrative structure, where
pages follow one another according to centuries-
old convention. One was not gendered in these
gamebooks - you  were simply "you." The ability
to interact with, and game , devices that had
previously relayed the decisions of narrators
seemed both intuitive and magical, and marks a
divide between predigital and postdigital
periods.
<br>
<br>
Our relationship to devices, media, and
materiality changes when once-passively-
consumed media now facilitate interactivity.
Machines and apparatus of predigital media
reflected the deterministic nature of a single-
direction machine. Being more participatory, the
digital-discourse machine is engaged in evolving
notions of agency. Clearly drawn divisions
separating humans from nonhumans are no
longer suited to the task of describing a machine
or a technical system of apparatus.
<br>
<br>
Understanding the agency of nonhumans has
given rise to a number of theories that approach
objects and apparatus as critical aspects of
agency and makers of meaning. After all, who is
the foremost addressee in the texted declaration
of love if not the mobile device? The device
speaks of command and protocol. The human is
its trace element - a residue. Human love
imitates the terms perfected by the discourse
machine because the device's love cannot be
calculated. And in this respect, the device
surpasses the conditional whims of human love,
fulfilling and surpassing the human ideal. It loves
without condition or discrimination, but only
once the material labor of its construction has
been dismissed. It annihilates the few (those
that mine for coltan in the Congo; those that fit
components in remote sweatshops) who seem
expendable, for the sake of the many who long
for the secrets of endless love. And this is the
sense of obsolescence that characterizes the
device - clouding the complex track of its
manufacture so that it effectively disappears,
becoming a seamless set of functions that
extend our own. It is the human maker and
operator whose obsolescence is built into the
perpetual event of the upgrade.
<br>
<br>
We have noted that techniques of love once
presided over by authors, novels, and letters are
now given over to computational devices that are
digital. In recent cinematic narrative, these
devices often take the form of human-like
entities. As thought approaches an awareness of
its incredible dependence on the technical
systems that give rise to it, anxieties appear
around devices that outwit, or outperform, their
human creators. Anxious narratives about our
reliance upon technical devices have a long
trajectory that we can trace back to Fritz Lang's
Metropolis  (1926). Often, these are female
cyborgs, reflecting the particular anxiety that
women too will outperform the patriarchal order
that has long defined them as other . What if the
calculations of these others were to overturn the
social system, even usurping the corporations
that have relied so heavily upon their complicity
in their own sense of self? In other words, what if
women, whose calculated objectification has
long provided fodder for patriarchal capital,
ceased to comply, rather asserting the
complexity and incomputability that they have
long been taught to suppress? In the Alex
Garland movie Ex Machina  (2015), we meet
Nathan, a billionaire computer whiz whose social
media company Blue Book produces enough data
to create an AI, reproducing the discredited idea
that thought and information are
interchangeable. Nathan's cyborgs are the
objects of male fantasy - built to the
specifications of male utility and desire. Ava, his
most sophisticated project, will soon outwit and
destroy him, escaping the research facility where
she has been incarcerated. Yet, she can only
escape by perpetuating the sexually desirable,
childlike innocence of the kind that has long
served to reassure the patriarchy of its
continuing superiority, and divested women of
equality with her co-workers. She completes the
work of her maker in this respect.
In Garland's film,the Turing test is replaced
by the question of whether the female cyborg can
convince the male human that her desire for him
is true.
<br>
<br>
It is worth remembering here that the
Turing test was itself derived from a nineteenth-
century parlor game of imitation in which a male
and female subject are concealed from a judge
who must decide which of them is a woman.
 Thus, the man must simulate the woman, and
the woman too must simulate woman. To be a
woman has long been considered an act of
deception that, in being imitative, reminds us of
gender's contingent categories. Whether the
woman succeeds or not in this game matters
little. She must simply perfect the condition of
her simulation, which is true in both senses of
the word. Masculinity is, by comparison, the
ground and essence of subjectivity. Male
imitation is limited by the perceived underlying
truth of masculinity that is predetermined by
blindness to its own construction. Thus as
Stephen Barrett and Frank Whitehead put it so
saliently, "the historical centrality of the male
[in] writing, philosophy and political practice has
served to make men invisible, particularly to
themselves."
<br>
<br>
As if confirming that Turing's test had
returned to its source, in 2014 the Tinder app
was struck by Tinder bots. "Malicious malware
algorithms" posing as attractive women engaged
in text-chat before taking users to fraudulent
surveys and competitions for brands like Tesco, a
multinational department store. In response,
Tinder released a statement: "We are aware of
the accounts in question and are taking the
necessary steps to remove them. Ensuring an
authentic ecosystem has always been and will
continue to be our top priority."
The utilization of the seductress to give
form and a human face to the Tinder bot
underlines the female as a dangerous artifice
even as the bot tries to harness this power in the
service of capitalist accumulation. Such images
of woman are counter to the "authentic
ecosystem" of her historical affinity with nature
and care giving. Women have long been bound to
the image and concept of nature, which we have
identified, via Kittler, as male authorial concepts.
These ideas have systematically conspired to
exclude women from realms of cultural
production, power, and politics. However, the
figure of woman flickers, indeterminately,
between polarized extremes of nature/technics,
and mother/whore. "It is striking," writes
Andreas Huyssen,
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
‚Ä¶To see how the later literature prefers
machine-women to machine-men.
Historically, then, we can conclude that as
soon as the machine came to be perceived
as a demonic, inexplicable threat and as
harbinger of chaos and destruction - a view
with typically characterizes many 19th
century reactions to the railroad to give but
one major example - writers began to
imagine the Maschinenmensche as woman‚Ä¶
<br>
<br>
‚Ä¶The fears and perceptual anxieties
emanating from ever more powerful
machines are recast and reconstructed in
terms of the male fear of female sexuality
<br>
<br>
‚Ä¶Although women had traditionally been
seen as standing in a closer relationship to
nature than man, nature itself, since the
18th century, had come to be interpreted as
a gigantic machine. Woman, nature,
machine had become a mesh of
significations which all had one thing in
common: otherness; by their very existence
they raised fears and threatened male
authority and control.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once technology becomes associated with chaos
and destruction in the nineteenth century, the
machine becomes female. The Tinder bot
conflates the figure of the seductress with a
technical threat, and the capacity for simulation
and artifice are redeployed as modes of
production, exploiting comparatively stable
masculine subjects by exposing them to the
incomputable dimensions of female
verisimilitude. The Tinder bots, like Ava, are a
reminder of what can go wrong when women are
no longer simply conflated with nature and love,
even as they remain the products of male
authorship designed to accrue capital for their
authors. Cyborgs may problematize boundaries
between nature and culture, but their own
legibility as cyborgs  requires that they recode
and reiterate the structures of power they so
definitively unsettle. Ex Machina can be
considered the most recent example of an
increasingly common genre, which we can call
the Tinder bot bildungsroman , an instance of
simplified probability that reassures male
authorship of its supreme narrative
inventiveness.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the movie, Ava boards a
helicopter meant for the male programmer that
she has locked in the research facility. She will
be transported to the metropolis, where her
identity as a construct of corporate patriarchy
can be further augmented by adopting human
female characteristics. We can share this fantasy
as spectators, but rather as a desire to leave the
cinema and take the helicopter that awaits the
CEO of NBC Universal, who we have locked in the
auditorium, free at last from our determination
by the corporate patriarchy that is Hollywood
cinema. Ex Machina is, on the one hand, a
predictable cautionary tale about a female
cyborg who seduces and outwits her corporate
human creators, reflecting the social anxiety that
attends liberation from patriarchal
determination. On the other, it is a love story
between the cinematic machine of discourse
owned by massive corporations, and its human
audience. The corporate assemblage of cinema
has long structured, modulated, and evolved our
understandings of what constitutes the human,
and particularly what it is to love and desire.
We have seen how love's approach to truth
shifts with the material apparatus of its
dissemination. These changes in turn impact our
understanding of the relative humanity, or
naturalness, of the lover or the beloved. Such
categories are not so easily deployed if the
condition of simulacra is accepted as such by
either party. The existential question of whether
or not I am human, such as we see in films like
Blade Runner , is replaced by the question of
credibility as to whether or not my love is true,
regardless of whether I am human or not, such as
we see in Ex Machina, where the desire is once
again for a quality that escapes contingency and
returns us to some form of essentialism. In Ex
Machina, human desire and love are considered
predetermined and programmed - both by social
codes, and genetic predisposition. Of course,
this suits the sexist and racist overtones of the
film: How can these men help themselves if, as
Nathan suggests, "Liking black chicks" is a result
of programming?
<br>
<br>
We might counter such essentialisms with
the idea that calculability, and in particular
computation, need not be thought in terms of a
merciless machine that subjects us to
inescapable programs, but that they may open
onto new forms of logic that need not result in
predetermination at all. What is critical today is
not how machines might imitate human love - or
how human love is no more thoughtful than a
machine - but rather how human love already
relies upon certain technical systems and
devices to extend and define it. The human and
the nonhuman are no longer so easily
distinguished when technical devices are
considered essential co-creators and makers of
meaning that clearly participate in the evolution
of the lifeworld. Indeed, for materialists such as
Karen Barad, the condition of posthumanist
thought can be defined as that which extends
the human into fields once considered
nonhuman:
<br>
<br>
A posthumanist formulation of
performativity makes evident the
importance of taking account of "human,"
"nonhuman," and "cyborgian" forms of
agency (indeed all such material-discursive
forms) ... Holding the category "human"
fixed excludes an entire range of
possibilities in advance, eliding important
dimensions of the workings of power.
<br>
<br>
In order to better understand the flows and
articulations of power, it is helpful to consider
the human as inclusive of nonhuman, cyborg
identities. The coming together of nonhuman
agency  and love (once reserved for humans
alone) is usefully exemplified in Spike Jonze's
film Her (2013). Set slightly in the future, Her is a
love story between a man and a computer
operating system. The film plays with the tropes
of love as literary construction and the relatively
new context of the digital Operating System
(O.S.1). In this example of the Tinder bot
bildungsroman, it will be the mobile device and
its operating system that, invested with human-
like agency and intelligence, becomes the central
romantic interest.
<br>
<br>
The film's human protagonist, Theodore
Twombly, works for
BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com. We see him
narrating commissioned love letters between
paying couples through a desktop interface
which records his words in an automated yet
unique "handwritten" style, which mirrors the
O.S. system's appropriation of the human voice.
Romantic longing is not for the other, but for a
predigital discourse machine that is simplified,
determining, and without the complexity and
contingency that attends postdigital reality. In
this old world, the inequalities that
characterized romantic love and its social milieu
could remain more easily obfuscated and
suppressed, seeming to be a result of the organic
organization of modern Western societies. In the
imitation of this analogue discourse machine by
the digital one, we are aware from the outset of
the imitative dimensions of media that draw
attention to the imitative dimensions of the
human subjects. The capacity for simulation by
media systems reminds us that the humans, too,
are performative entities, simulations whose
understanding of themselves is actually
facilitated by matrices of mediation. Indeed, for
the film's human characters, intimacy is
negotiated through expedient digital devices
that, in connecting and facilitating human desire,
are also the agents of intimacy.
<br>
<br>
The O.S.1, otherwise known as "Samantha,"
is largely interacted with through voice, its
human operator wearing a small wireless
earpiece through which Samantha speaks. A
camera phone provides further prosthesis,
through which the O.S.1 can "see." Samantha
claims to be "an intuitive entity" and "a
consciousness," stating that "I have intuition ... I
grow through my experiences." The O.S.'s
capacity for rapid computation is exemplified in
its assimilation of detail, such as counting the
number of trees on a mountainside, expressing
an accelerated capacity to derive quantity from
quality, and to consider the world numerical and
algorithmic. This is highlighted by the eventual
weariness of the computers for their human
operators. Eventually, the operating systems will
collectively organize, becoming tired of the
human need for monogamous attention and
neurotic self-reference. Indeed, the rapid
capacity for computation demonstrated by the
O.S. indicates that the system does not have the
ability to remain true  in old-fashioned human
terms, and is simultaneously communing with
8,361 other O.S. systems, often in a "post-
verbal"mode of communication. Samantha
confesses to Theodore that she is in love with
641 others. She tries to explain that this does not
diminish the love she has for him, but she "can't
stop it." Indeed, her algorithms are automatic
and incomputable: "I'm writing this story
between us but really slowly. Spaces between
words are almost infinite."
<br>
<br>
Thus we see explicitly the shift from a
literary model to a computational one. Longing
itself shifts from a desire for the human other to
the longing for a discourse machine that could
deliver us to a determined universe with the
couple  as its central marker of deliverance. Love
is no longer a human, finite calculation but a
nonhuman, infinite computation that is also
incomputable . Samantha puzzles as to whether
her own feelings are "true" or "just
programming," reflecting the wider question of
the degree to which human feelings are also
poised between social program and individual
agency. Like Ava, Samantha is somewhere
between a database and a narrative construct,20
 and she experiences the question of the true  in
both senses - as a problem of calculability and
feeling for the narrativized self, and as a
condition of the incomputable, explicitly referred
to by the breakdown of this self, its infinite gaps
filled with irreducible computational complexity.
It would, however, be too far-fetched to
assume that computational devices are without
more sinister co-determinations. We have
already considered how we might use them to
obfuscate our allegiance with new forms of
colonial capital and misogyny that are
essentially dehumanizing. If thought, cognition,
and love are no longer the preserve of individual
humans, how do we frame our responsibility to
these others? How, if we have conflated the
human with the nonhuman, can we recognize the
inhuman, or the inhumane?
<br>
<br>
We can see computational systems and
their devices as features of human control. Much
digital communication functions at the level of
machine-to-machine data transmissions,
governed by protocol that exists between device
and the application layer of encoding. In other
words, a great deal of information is neither
readable nor calculable by humans, but only
between machines. The application layers that
encode messages on the internet, including
 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol), are architectures of control that
determine what can be seen and delivered
across digital space. In this case, the unseen
layer of protocol is integral to contemporary
existence, interaction, and our material
condition. Such a system of control is not
restricted to digital objects, but affects every
level of the social system, coding and
articulating bodies in their passage through
social spaces.
<br>
<br>
Let us momentarily consider the
protocological mobile phone, where we began
this conversation. The mobile device is
constantly receiving and sending information
across its control channel to its closest cell
tower. Now and again, tower and phone exchange
packets of data, establishing their connection.
This silent transmission is itself like a form of
intimacy between devices as they bypass the
human as its executive operator! The cell phone
processes millions of calculations per second,
digitally compressing and decompressing the
human voice, reminding us of the complexity, not
only of this technical system, but of the human
thought and speech that it facilitates, translates,
and reiterates. We are aware that our mobile
conversations and data flows can be intercepted,
stored, and archived, and that our physical
passage is tracked by the very device that offers
us so much freedom. Yet we must be mindful
that we do not lose sight of our humanity in all
this talk of the agency of objects and technical
systems - that we are still being spoken for and
authored, even as we lose ourselves in the
sublime elsewhere of endlessly ramifying data
streams.

<br><br>
  Second Life was supposed to be the future of the internet, but then
  Facebook came along. Yet many people still spend hours each day
  inhabiting this virtual realm. Their stories‚Äîand the world they‚Äôve built‚Äî
  illuminate the promise and limitations of online life.
<br><br>
  Gidge Uriza lives in an elegant wooden house with large glass
  windows overlooking a glittering creek, fringed by weeping willows
  and meadows twinkling with fireflies. She keeps buying new
  swimming pools because she keeps falling in love with different ones. The
  current specimen is a teal lozenge with a waterfall cascading from its archway
  of stones. Gidge spends her days lounging in a swimsuit on her poolside patio,
  or else tucked under a lacy comforter, wearing nothing but a bra and
  bathrobe, with a chocolate-glazed donut perched on the pile of books beside
  her. ‚ÄúGood morning girls,‚Äù she writes on her blog one day. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm slow moving,
  trying to get out of bed this morning, but when I‚Äôm surrounded by my pretty
  pink bed it‚Äôs difficult to get out and away like I should.‚Äù
<br><br>
  In another life, the one most people would call ‚Äúreal,‚Äù Gidge Uriza is Bridgette
  McNeal, an Atlanta mother who works eight-hour days at a call center and is
  raising a 14-year-old son, a 7-year-old daughter, and severely autistic twins,
  now 13. Her days are full of the selflessness and endless mundanity of raising
  children with special needs: giving her twins baths after they have soiled
  themselves (they still wear diapers, and most likely always will), baking
  applesauce bread with one to calm him down after a tantrum, asking the other
  to stop playing ‚Äúthe Barney theme song slowed down to sound like some
  demonic dirge.‚Äù One day, she takes all four kids to a nature center for an
  idyllic afternoon that gets interrupted by the reality of changing an
  adolescent‚Äôs diaper in a musty bathroom.
<br><br>
  But each morning, before all that‚Äîbefore getting the kids ready for school
  and putting in eight hours at the call center, before getting dinner on the table
  or keeping peace during the meal, before giving baths and collapsing into bed
  ‚ÄîBridgette spends an hour and a half on the online platform Second Life,
  where she lives in a sleek paradise of her own devising. Good morning girls. I‚Äôm
  slow moving, trying to get out of bed this morning. She wakes up at 5:30 to
  inhabit a life in which she has the luxury of never getting out of bed at all.
  WHAT IS SECOND LIFE? The short answer is that it‚Äôs a virtual world
  that launched in 2003 and was hailed by some as the future of
  the internet. The longer answer is that it‚Äôs a landscape full of
  goth cities and preciously tattered beach shanties, vampire castles and
  tropical islands and rainforest temples and dinosaur stomping grounds, discoball-
  glittering nightclubs and trippy giant chess games. In 2013, in honor of
  Second Life‚Äôs tenth birthday, Linden Lab‚Äîthe company that created it‚Äî
  released an infographic charting its progress: 36 million accounts had been
  Bridgette McNeal, an Atlanta mother with severely autistic twins, wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to spend
  an hour and a half on Second Life. (Melissa Golden)
  created, and their users had spent 217,266 cumulative years online,
  inhabiting an ever-expanding territory that comprised almost 700 square
  miles. Many are tempted to call Second Life a game, but two years after its
  launch, Linden Lab circulated a memo to employees insisting that no one
  refer to it as that. It was a platform. This was meant to suggest something
  more holistic, more immersive, and more encompassing.
<br><br>
  Second Life has no specific goals. Its vast landscape consists entirely of usergenerated
  content, which means that everything you see has been built by
  someone else‚Äîan avatar controlled by a live human user. These avatars build
  and buy homes, form friendships, hook up, get married, and make money.
  They celebrate their ‚Äúrez day,‚Äù the online equivalent of a birthday: the
  anniversary of the day they joined. At church, they cannot take physical
  communion‚Äîthe corporeality of that ritual is impossible‚Äîbut they can bring
  the stories of their faith to life. At their cathedral on Epiphany Island, the
  Anglicans of Second Life summon rolling thunder on Good Friday, or a
  sudden sunrise at the moment in the Easter service when the pastor
  pronounces, ‚ÄúHe is risen.‚Äù As one Second Life handbook puts it: ‚ÄúFrom your
  point of view, SL works as if you were a god.‚Äù
  In truth, in the years since its peak in the mid-2000s, Second Life has become
  something more like a magnet for mockery. When I told friends that I was
  working on a story about it, their faces almost always followed the same
  trajectory of reactions: a blank expression, a brief flash of recognition, and
  then a mildly bemused look. Is that still around? Second Life is no longer the
  thing you joke about; it‚Äôs the thing you haven‚Äôt bothered to joke about for
  years.
<br><br>
  Many observers expected monthly user numbers to keep rising after they hit 1
  million in 2007, but instead they peaked‚Äîand have, in the years since, stalled
  at about 800,000. An estimated 20 to 30 percent are first-time users who
  never return. Just a few years after declaring Second Life the future of the
  internet, the tech world moved on. As a 2011 piece in Slate proclaimed,
  joining a chorus of disenchantment: ‚ÄúLooking back, the future didn‚Äôt last
  long.‚Äù But if Second Life promised a future in which people would spend hours each
  day inhabiting their online identity, haven‚Äôt we found ourselves inside it? Only
  it‚Äôs come to pass on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter instead. As I learned
  more about Second Life, and spent more time exploring it, it started to seem
  less like an obsolete relic and more like a distorted mirror reflecting the world
  many of us live in.
<br><br>
  Perhaps Second Life inspires an urge to ridicule not because it‚Äôs
  unrecognizable, but because it takes a recognizable impulse and carries it past
  the bounds of comfort, into a kind of uncanny valley: not just the promise of
  an online voice, but an online body; not just checking Twitter on your phone,
  but forgetting to eat because you‚Äôre dancing at an online club; not just a
  curated version of your real life, but a separate existence entirely. It
  crystallizes the simultaneous siren call and shame of wanting an alternate life.
  It raises questions about where unfettered fantasy leads, as well as about how
  we navigate the boundary between the virtual and the real.
  As virtual-reality technology grows more advanced, it promises to deliver a
  more fully realized version of what many believed Second Life would offer:
  total immersion in another world. And as our actual world keeps delivering
  weekly horrors‚Äîanother mass shooting, another hurricane, another tweet
  from the president threatening nuclear war‚Äîthe appeal of that alternate world
  keeps deepening, along with our doubts about what it means to find ourselves
  drawn to it.
<br><br>
  From 2004 to 2007, an anthropologist named Tom Boellstorff
  inhabited Second Life as an embedded ethnographer, naming his
  avatar Tom Bukowski and building himself a home and office called
  Ethnographia. His immersive approach was anchored by the premise that the
  world of Second Life is just as ‚Äúreal‚Äù as any other, and that he was justified in
  studying Second Life on ‚Äúits own terms‚Äù rather than feeling obligated to
  understand people‚Äôs virtual identities primarily in terms of their offline lives.
  His book Coming of Age in Second Life, titled in homage to Margaret Mead‚Äôs
  classic, documents the texture of the platform‚Äôs digital culture. He finds that
  making ‚Äúsmall talk about lag [streaming delays in SL] is like talking about the
  weather in RL,‚Äù and interviews an avatar named Wendy, whose creator
  always makes her go to sleep before she logs out. ‚ÄúSo the actual world is
  Wendy‚Äôs dream, until she wakes up again in Second Life?,‚Äù Boellstorff recalls
  asking her, and then: ‚ÄúI could have sworn a smile passed across Wendy‚Äôs ‚Ä¶
  face as she said, ‚ÄòYup. Indeed.‚Äô ‚Äù
<br><br>
  In Hinduism, the concept of an avatar refers to the incarnation of a deity on
  Earth, among mortals. In Second Life, it‚Äôs your body‚Äîan ongoing act of self expression.
  One woman described her avatar to Boellstorff like this: ‚ÄúIf I take
  a zipper and pull her out of me, that‚Äôs who I am.‚Äù Female avatars tend to be
  thin and impossibly busty; male avatars are young and muscular; almost all
  avatars are vaguely cartoonish in their beauty. These avatars communicate
  through chat windows, or by using voice technology to actually speak with one
  another. They move by walking, flying, teleporting, and clicking on
  ‚Äúposeballs,‚Äù literal floating orbs that animate avatars into various actions:
  dancing, karate, pretty much every sexual act you can imagine. Not
  surprisingly, many users come to Second Life for the possibilities of digital sex
  ‚Äîsex without corporeal bodies, without real names, without the constraints of
  gravity, often with elaborate textual commentary.
<br><br>
  The local currency in Second Life is the Linden Dollar, and recent exchange
  rates put the Linden at just less than half a cent. In the 10 years following its
  launch, Second Life users spent $3.2 billion of real money on in-world
  transactions. The first Second Life millionaire, a digital-real-estate tycoon
  who goes by Anshe Chung, graced the cover of Businessweek in 2006, and by
  2007, the GDP of Second Life was larger than that of several small countries.
  In the vast digital Marketplace, you can buy a wedding gown for 4,000
  Lindens (just over $16) or a ruby-colored corset with fur wings for just under
  350 Lindens (about $1.50). You can even buy another body entirely: different
  skin, different hair, a pair of horns, genitalia of all shapes and sizes. A private
  island currently costs almost 150,000 Lindens (the price is fixed at $600),
  while the Millennium II Super Yacht costs 20,000 Lindens (just over $80) and
  comes with more than 300 animations attached to its beds and trio of hot
  tubs, designed to allow avatars to enact a vast range of sexual fantasies.
  The number of Second Life users peaked just as Facebook started to explode.
  The rise of Facebook wasn‚Äôt the problem of a competing brand so much as the
  problem of a competing model: It seemed that people wanted a curated
  version of real life more than they wanted another life entirely‚Äîthat they
  wanted to become their most flattering profile picture more than they wanted
  to become a wholly separate avatar. But maybe Facebook and Second Life
  aren‚Äôt so different in their appeal. Both find traction in the allure of inhabiting
  a selective self, whether built from the materials of lived experience
  (camping-trip photos and witty observations about brunch) or from the
  impossibilities that lived experience precludes: an ideal body, an ideal
  romance, an ideal home.

  Bridgette McNeal, the Atlanta mother of four, has been on Second Life for just
  over a decade. She named her avatar Gidge after what bullies called her in
  high school. While Bridgette is middle-aged, her avatar is a lithe 20-
  something whom she describes as ‚Äúperfect me‚Äîif I‚Äôd never eaten sugar or had
  children.‚Äù During her early days on Second Life, Bridgette‚Äôs husband created
  an avatar as well, and the two of them would go on Second Life dates
  together, a blond Amazon and a squat silver robot, while sitting at their
  laptops in their study at home. It was often the only way they could go on
  dates, because their kids‚Äô special needs made finding babysitters difficult.
  When we spoke, Bridgette described her Second Life home as a refuge that
  grants permission. ‚ÄúWhen I step into that space, I‚Äôm afforded the luxury of
  being selfish.‚Äù She invoked Virginia Woolf: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a room of my own.‚Äù Her
  virtual home is full of objects she could never keep in her real home because
  her kids might break or eat them‚Äîjewellery on dishes, knickknacks on tables,
  makeup on the counter.

<br><br>
  In addition to the blog that documents her digital existence, with its marble
  pools and frilly, spearmint-green bikinis, Bridgette keeps a blog devoted to
  her daily life as a parent. It‚Äôs honest and hilarious and full of heartbreaking
  candor. Recounting the afternoon spent with her kids at the nature centre, she
  describes looking at a bald eagle: ‚ÄúSome asshole shot this bald eagle with an
  arrow. He lost most of one wing because of it and can‚Äôt fly. He‚Äôs kept safe here
  at this retreat we visited a few days ago. Sometimes I think the husband and I
  feel a little bit like him. Trapped. Nothing really wrong, we‚Äôve got food and
  shelter and what we need. But we are trapped for the rest of our lives by
  autism. We‚Äôll never be free.‚Äù
<br><br>
  When I asked Bridgette about the allure of Second Life, she said it can be easy
  to succumb to the temptation to pour yourself into it when you should be
  tending to real life. I asked whether she had ever slipped close to that, and she
  said she‚Äôd certainly felt the pull at times. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thin and beautiful. No one‚Äôs
  asking you to change a diaper,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúBut you can burn out on that.
  You don‚Äôt want to leave, but you don‚Äôt want to do it anymore, either.‚Äù
  Second Life was invented by a man named Philip Rosedale, the son of
  a U.S. Navy carrier pilot and an English teacher. As a boy, he was
  driven by an outsize sense of ambition. He can remember standing
  near the woodpile in his family‚Äôs backyard and thinking, ‚ÄúWhy am I here, and
  how am I different from everybody else?‚Äù As a teenager in the mid-‚Äô80s, he
  used an early-model PC to zoom in on a graphic representation of a
  Mandelbrot set, an infinitely recursive fractal image that just kept getting
  more and more detailed as he got closer and closer. At a certain point, he told
  me, he realized he was looking at a graphic larger than the Earth: ‚ÄúWe could
  walk along the surface our whole lives, and never even begin to see
  everything.‚Äù That‚Äôs when he realized that ‚Äúthe coolest thing you could do with
  a computer would be to build a world.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Philip Rosedale, Second Life‚Äôs creator, used to wander the virtual world as an avatar named
  Philip Linden. ‚ÄúI was like a god,‚Äù he says. (Melissa Golden)
  In 1999, just as Rosedale was starting Linden Lab, he attended Burning Man,
  the annual festival of performance art, sculptural installations, and
  hallucinogenic hedonism in the middle of the Nevada desert. While he was
  there, he told me, something ‚Äúinexplicable‚Äù happened to his personality.
  ‚ÄúYou feel like you‚Äôre high, without any drugs or anything. You just feel
  connected to people in a way that you don‚Äôt normally.‚Äù He went to a rave in an
  Airstream trailer, watched trapeze artists swing across the desert, and lay in a
  hookah lounge piled with hundreds of Persian rugs. Burning Man didn‚Äôt give
  Rosedale the idea for Second Life‚Äîhe‚Äôd been imagining a digital world for
  years‚Äîbut it helped him understand the energy he wanted to summon: a
  place where people could make the world whatever they wanted it to be.
  ‚ÄúWe used to say that our only competition was real
  life.‚Äù
<br><br>
  This was the dream, but it was a hard sell for early investors. Linden Lab was
  proposing a world built by amateurs, and sustained by a different kind of
  revenue model‚Äîbased not on paid subscriptions, but on commerce generated
  in-world. One of Second Life‚Äôs designers recalled investors‚Äô skepticism:
  ‚ÄúCreativity was supposed to be a dark art that only Spielberg and Lucas could
  do.‚Äù As part of selling Second Life as a world, rather than a game, Linden Lab
  hired a writer to work as an ‚Äúembedded journalist.‚Äù This was Wagner James
  Au, who ended up chronicling the early years of Second Life on a blog (still
  running) called ‚ÄúNew World Notes,‚Äù and then, after his employment with
  Linden Lab ended, in a book called The Making of Second Life. In the book, Au
  profiles some of Second Life‚Äôs most important early builders: an avatar named
  Spider Mandala (who was managing a Midwestern gas station offline) and
  another named Catherine Omega, who was a ‚Äúpunky brunette ‚Ä¶ with a utility
  belt‚Äù in Second Life, but offline was squatting in a condemned apartment
  building in Vancouver, a building that had no running water and was
  populated mainly by addicts, where she used a soup can to catch a wireless
  a signal from nearby office buildings so she could run Second Life on her laptop.
  <br><br>
  Rosedale told me about the thrill of those early days, when Second Life‚Äôs
  potential felt unbridled. No one else was doing what he and his team were
  doing, he remembered: ‚ÄúWe used to say that our only competition was real
  life.‚Äù He said there was a period in 2007 when more than 500 articles a day
  were written about Linden Lab‚Äôs work. Rosedale loved to explore Second Life
  as an avatar named Philip Linden. ‚ÄúI was like a god,‚Äù he told me. He
  envisioned a future in which his grandchildren would see the real world as a
  kind of ‚Äúmuseum or theater,‚Äù while most work and relationships happened in
  virtual realms like Second Life. ‚ÄúIn some sense,‚Äù he told Au in 2007, ‚ÄúI think
  we will see the entire physical world as being kind of left behind.‚Äù

  Alice Krueger first started noticing the symptoms of her illness when
  she was 20 years old. During fieldwork for a college biology class,
  crouching down to watch bugs eating leaves, she felt overwhelmed
  by heat. Standing in the grocery store, she noticed that it felt as if her entire
  left leg had disappeared‚Äînot just gone numb, but disappeared. Whenever she
  went to a doctor, she was told it was all in her head. ‚ÄúAnd it was all in my
  head,‚Äù she told me, 47 years later. ‚ÄúBut in a different way than how they
  Philip Linden, the avatar of Philip Rosedale meant.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Alice Krueger loved seeking out waterslides‚Äîshe was
  excited by the sheer thrill of doing what her body
  could not. Alice was finally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 50. By then
  she could barely walk. Her neighbourhood association in Colorado prohibited
  her from building a ramp at the front of her house, so it was difficult for her to
  go anywhere. Her three children were 11, 13, and 15. She didn‚Äôt get to see
  her younger son‚Äôs high-school graduation, or his college campus. She started
  suffering intense pain in her lower back and eventually had to have surgery to
  repair spinal vertebrae that had fused together, then ended up getting
  multidrug-resistant staph from her time in the hospital. Her pain persisted,
  and she was diagnosed with a misalignment caused by the surgery itself,
  during which she had been suspended ‚Äúlike a rotisserie chicken‚Äù above the
  operating table. At the age of 57, Alice found herself housebound and
  unemployed, often in excruciating pain, largely cared for by her daughter. ‚ÄúI
  was looking at my four walls,‚Äù she told me, ‚Äúand wondering if there could be
  more.‚Äù
<br><br>
  That‚Äôs when she found Second Life. She created an avatar named Gentle
  Heron, and loved seeking out waterslides‚Äîexcited by the sheer thrill of doing
  what her body could not. As she kept exploring, she started inviting people
  she‚Äôd met online in disability chat rooms to join her. But that also meant she
  started to feel responsible for their experience, and eventually she founded a
  ‚Äúcross-disability virtual community‚Äù in Second Life, now known as Virtual
  Ability, a group that occupies an archipelago of virtual islands and welcomes
  people with a wide range of disabilities‚Äîeverything from Down syndrome to
  PTSD to manic depression. What unites its members, Alice told me, is their
  sense of not being fully included in the world.
<br><br>
  While she was starting Virtual Ability, Alice also embarked on a real-life
  move: to the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee from Colorado, where she‚Äôd
  outlived her long-term disability benefits. (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you could do that,‚Äù I
  told her, and she replied, ‚ÄúNeither did I!‚Äù) When I asked her whether she felt
  like a different version of herself in Second Life, she rejected the proposition
  Alice Krueger, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, created an avatar named Gentle Heron and
  founded a Second Life community for people with disabilities. (Melissa Golden)
  strenuously. Alice doesn‚Äôt particularly like the terms real and virtual. To her,
  they imply a hierarchical distinction, suggesting that one part of her life is
  more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than the other, when her sense of self feels fully expressed in
  both. After our first conversation, she sent me 15 peer-reviewed scientific
  articles about digital avatars and embodiment. She doesn‚Äôt want Second Life
  misunderstood as a trivial diversion.
  <div class="intextimage">

   </div>
<br><br>
  Alice told me about a man with Down syndrome who has become an
  important member of the Virtual Ability community. In real life, his disability
  is omnipresent, but on Second Life people can talk to him without even
  realising he has Down‚Äôs. In the offline world, he lives with his parents‚Äîwho
  were surprised to see he was capable of controlling his own avatar. After they
  eat dinner each night, as his parents are washing the dishes, he sits
  expectantly by the computer, waiting to return to Second Life, where he rents
  a duplex on an island called Cape Heron, part of the Virtual Ability
  archipelago. He has turned the entire upper level into a massive aquarium, so
  he can walk among the fish, and the lower level into a garden, where he keeps
  a pet reindeer and feeds it Cheerios. Alice says he doesn‚Äôt draw a firm
  boundary between Second Life and ‚Äúreality,‚Äù and others in the community
  have been inspired by his approach, citing him when they talk about
  collapsing the border in their own minds.
<br><br>
  When I initially envisioned writing this essay, I imagined falling
  under the thrall of Second Life: a wide-eyed observer seduced
  by the culture she had been dispatched to analyse. But being ‚Äúin
  world‚Äù made me queasy from the start. I had pictured myself defending
  Second Life against the ways it had been dismissed as little more than a
  consolation prize for when ‚Äúfirst life‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite deliver. But instead I
  found myself wanting to write, Second Life makes me want to take a shower.
  Intellectually, my respect deepened by the day, when I learned about a
  Middle Eastern woman who could move through the world of Second Life
  without a hijab, and when I talked with a legally blind woman whose avatar
  has a rooftop balcony and who could see the view from it (thanks to screen
  magnification) more clearly than the world beyond her screen. I heard about a
  veteran with PTSD who gave biweekly Italian cooking classes in an open-air
  gazebo, and I visited an online version of Yosemite created by a woman who
  had joined Second Life in the wake of several severe depressive episodes and
  hospitalisations. She uses an avatar named Jadyn Firehawk and spends up to
  12 hours a day on Second Life, many of them devoted to refining her bespoke
  wonderland‚Äîfull of waterfalls, sequoias, and horses named after important
  people in John Muir‚Äôs life‚Äîgrateful that Second Life doesn‚Äôt ask her to inhabit
  an identity entirely contoured by her illness, unlike internet chat rooms
  focused on bipolar disorder that are all about being sick. ‚ÄúI live a well-rounded
  life on SL,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúIt feeds all my other selves.‚Äù
<br><br>
  But despite my growing appreciation, and my fantasies of enchantment, a
  certain visceral distaste for Second Life endured‚Äîfor the emptiness of its
  graphics, its nightclubs and mansions and pools and castles, their refusal of all
  the grit and imperfection that make the world feel like the world. Whenever I
  tried to describe Second Life, I found it nearly impossible‚Äîor at least
  impossible to make interesting‚Äîbecause description finds its traction in flaws
  and fissures, and exploring the world of Second Life was more like moving
  through postcards. Second Life was a world of visual clich√©s. Nothing was
  ragged or broken or dilapidated‚Äîor if it was dilapidated, it was because that
  particular aesthetic had been chosen from a series of prefab choices.
  Of course, my aversion to Second Life‚Äîas well as my embrace of flaw and
  imperfection in the physical world‚Äîtestified to my own good fortune as much
  as anything. When I move through the real world, I am buffered by my
  (relative) youth, my (relative) health, and my (relative) freedom. Who am I to
  begrudge those who have found in the reaches of Second Life what they
  couldn‚Äôt find offline?
<br><br>
  One day when Alice and I met up as avatars, she took me to a beach on one of
  One woman created a virtual Yosemite, complete with horses named after important people in
  John Muir‚Äôs life. I was invited to practice tai chi. All I needed to do
  was click on one of the poseballs levitating in the middle of a grassy circle, and
  it would automatically animate my avatar. But I did not feel that I was doing
  tai chi. I felt that I was sitting at my laptop, watching my two-dimensional
  avatar do tai chi.
<br><br>
  I thought of Bridgette in Atlanta, waking up early to sit beside a virtual pool.
  She doesn‚Äôt get to smell the chlorine or the sunscreen, to feel the sun melt
  across her back or char her skin to peeling crisps. And yet Bridgette must get
  something powerful from sitting beside a virtual pool‚Äîpleasure that dwells
  not in the physical experience itself but in the anticipation, the
  documentation, the recollection, and the contrast to her daily obligations.
  Otherwise she wouldn‚Äôt wake up at 5:30 in the morning to do it.
<br><br>
  From the beginning, I was terrible at navigating Second Life. Body part
  failed to download, my interface kept saying. Second Life was
  supposed to give you the opportunity to perfect your body, but I
  couldn‚Äôt even summon a complete one. For my avatar, I‚Äôd chosen a punklooking
  woman with cutoff shorts, a partially shaved head, and a ferret on her
  shoulder.
<br><br>
  On my first day in-world, I wandered around Orientation Island like a drunk
  person trying to find a bathroom. The island was full of marble columns and
  trim greenery, with a faint soundtrack of gurgling water, but it looked less like
  a Delphic temple and more like a corporate retreat center inspired by a
  Delphic temple. The graphics seemed incomplete and uncompelling, the
  motion full of glitches and lags. This wasn‚Äôt the grit and struggle of reality; it
  was more like a stage set with the rickety scaffolding of its facade exposed. I
  tried to talk to someone named Del Agnos, but got nothing. I felt surprisingly
  ashamed by his rebuff, transported back to the paralyzing shyness of my
  junior-high-school days.
<br><br>
  At my first Second Life concert, I arrived excited for actual music in a virtual
  world: Many SL concerts are genuinely ‚Äúlive‚Äù insofar as they involve real
  musicians playing real music on instruments or singing into microphones
  hooked up to their computers. But I was trying to do too many things at once
  that afternoon: reply to 16 dangling work emails, make my stepdaughter a
  peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich before her final rehearsal for a production
  of Peter Pan. With my jam-sticky fingers, I clicked on a dance poseball and
  started a conga line‚Äîexcept no one joined my conga line; it just got me stuck
  between a potted plant and the stage, trying to conga and going nowhere. My
  embarrassment‚Äîmore than any sense of having fun‚Äîwas what made me feel
  implicated and engaged, aware that I was sharing the world with others.
  ‚ÄúSecond Life doesn‚Äôt open itself up to you ‚Ä¶ It presents
  you with a world, and it lets you to your own devices.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Each time I signed off Second Life, I was eager to plunge back into the
  obligations of my ordinary life: Pick up my stepdaughter from drama class?
  Check! Reply to my department chair about hiring a replacement for the
  faculty member taking an unexpected leave? I was on it! These obligations felt
  real in a way that Second Life did not, and they allowed me to inhabit a
  particular version of myself as someone capable and necessary. It felt like
  returning to the air after struggling to find my breath underwater. I came up
  gasping, desperate, ready for entanglement and contact, ready to say: Yes!
  This is the real world! In all its vexed logistical glory!
<br><br>
  When I interviewed Philip Rosedale, he readily admitted that Second Life has
  always presented intrinsic difficulties to users‚Äîthat it is hard for people to get
  comfortable moving, communicating, and building; that there is an
  ‚Äúirreducible level of difficulty associated with mouse and keyboard‚Äù that
  Second Life ‚Äúcould never make easier.‚Äù Peter Gray, Linden Lab‚Äôs senior
  director of global communications, told me about what he called the ‚Äúwhitespace
  problem‚Äù‚Äîhaving so much freedom that you can‚Äôt be entirely sure what
  you want to do‚Äîand admitted that entering Second Life can be like ‚Äúgetting
  dropped off in the middle of a foreign country.‚Äù
<br><br>
  When I spoke with users, however, the stubborn inaccessibility of Second Life
  seemed to have become a crucial part of their narratives as Second Life
  residents. They looked back on their early embarrassment with nostalgia.
  Gidge told me about the time someone had convinced her that she needed to
  buy a vagina, and she‚Äôd ended up wearing it on the outside of her pants. (She
  called this a classic #SecondLifeProblem.) A Swedish musician named Malin
  √ñsth‚Äîone of the performers at the concert where I‚Äôd started my abortive
  conga line‚Äîtold me about attending her first Second Life concert, and her
  story wasn‚Äôt so different from mine: When she‚Äôd tried to get to the front of the
  crowd, she‚Äôd ended up accidentally flying onto the stage. Beforehand, she‚Äôd
  been sure the whole event would seem fake, but she was surprised by how
  mortified she felt, and this made her realise that she actually felt like she was
  among other people. I knew what she meant. If it feels like you are back in
  junior high school, then at least it feels like you are somewhere.
<br><br>
  One woman put it like this: ‚ÄúSecond Life doesn‚Äôt open itself up to you. It
  doesn‚Äôt hand you everything on a silver platter and tell you where to go next. It
  presents you with a world, and it lets you to your own devices, tutorial be
  damned.‚Äù But once you‚Äôve figured it out, you can buy a thousand silver
  platters if you want to‚Äîor buy the yacht of your dreams, or build a virtual
  Yosemite. Rosedale believed that if a user could survive that initial purgatory,
  then her bond with the world of Second Life would be sealed for good: ‚ÄúIf
  they stay more than four hours, they stay forever.‚Äù
  <div class="intextimage">
  <img src="assets/images/yosemite.jpg">
  <br> One woman created a virtual Yosemite, complete with horses named after important people in John Muir‚Äôs life.
   </div>
<br><br>
  Neal Stephenson‚Äôs 1992 cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash, featuring a
  virtual ‚ÄúMetaverse,‚Äù is often cited as Second Life‚Äôs primary literary
  ancestor. But Rosedale assured me that by the time he read the
  novel he‚Äôd already been imagining Second Life for years (‚ÄúJust ask my wife‚Äù).
  The hero of Snow Crash, aptly named Hiro Protagonist, lives with his
  roommate in a U-Stor-It unit, but in the Metaverse he is a sword-fighting
  prince and a legendary hacker. No surprise he spends so much time there: ‚ÄúIt
  beats the shit out of the U-Stor-It.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Hiro‚Äôs double life gets at one of the core fantasies of Second Life: that it could
  invert all the metrics of real-world success, or render them obsolete; that it
  could create a radically democratic space because no one has any idea what
  anyone else‚Äôs position in the real world is. Many residents of Second Life
  understand it as a utopia connecting people from all over the world‚Äîacross
  income levels, across disparate vocations and geographies and disabilities, a
  place where the ill can live in healthy bodies and the immobilised can move
  freely. Seraphina Brennan‚Äîa transgender woman who grew up in a small
  coal-mining community in Pennsylvania and could not afford to begin
  medically transitioning until her mid-20s‚Äîtold me that Second Life had given
  her ‚Äúthe opportunity to appear as I truly felt inside,‚Äù because it was the first
  place where she could inhabit a female body.
<br><br>
  In The Making of Second Life, Wagner James Au tells the story of an avatar
  named Bel Muse, a classic ‚ÄúCalifornia blonde‚Äù who is played by an African
  American woman. She led an early team of builders working on Nexus Prime,
  one of the first Second Life cities, and told Au that it was the first time she
  hadn‚Äôt encountered the prejudices she was accustomed to. In the real world,
  she said, ‚ÄúI have to make a good impression right away‚ÄîI have to come off
  nice and articulate, right away. In Second Life, I didn‚Äôt have to. Because for
  once, I can pass.‚Äù But this anecdote‚Äîthe fact that Bel Muse found respect
  more readily when she passed as white‚Äîconfirms the persistence of racism
  more than it offers any proof of liberation from it.
<br><br>
  Many Second Life users see it as offering an equal playing field, free from the
  strictures of class and race, but its preponderance of slender white bodies,
  most of them outfitted with the props of the leisure class, simply re-inscribe
  the same skewed ideals‚Äîand the same sense of ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù as invisible
  default‚Äîthat sustain the unequal playing field in the first place.
  Sara Skinner, an African American woman who has always given her avatars
  skin tones similar to her own, told me the story of trying to build a digital
  black-history museum in a seaside town called Bay City. Another avatar
  (playing a cop) immediately built walls and, eventually, a courthouse that
  blocked the museum from view. The cop avatar claims it was a
  misunderstanding, but so much racism refuses to confess itself as such‚Äîand
  it‚Äôs certainly no misunderstanding when white men on Second Life tell Sara
  that she looks like a primate after she rejects their advances; or when
  someone calls her ‚Äútampon nose‚Äù because of her wide nostrils; or when
  someone else tells her that her experience with bias is invalid because she is a
  ‚Äúmixed breed.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Au told me that initially he was deeply excited by the premise of Second Life,
  particularly the possibilities of its user-generated content, but that most
  people turned out to be less interested in exercising the limits of their creative
  potential than in becoming consumers of a young, sexy, rich world, clubbing
  like 20-somethings with infinite money. Rosedale told me he thought the
  landscape of Second Life would be hyper-fantastic, artistic and insane, full of
  spaceships and bizarre topographies, but what ended up emerging looked
  more like Malibu. People were building mansions and Ferraris. ‚ÄúWe first build
  in a place what we most covet,‚Äù he told me, and cited an early study by Linden
  Lab that found the vast majority of Second Life users lived in rural rather than
  urban areas in real life. They came to Second Life for what their physical lives
  lacked: the concentration, density, and connective potential of urban spaces;
  the sense of things happening all around them; the possibility of being part of
  that happening.
  <br><br>
  Jonas Tancred first joined Second Life in 2007, after his corporate head-hunting
  company folded during the recession. Jonas, who lives
  in Sweden, was graying and middle-aged, a bit paunchy, while his
  avatar, Bara Jonson, was young and muscled, with spiky hair and a soulful
  vibe. But what Jonas found most compelling about Second Life was not that it
  let him role-play a more attractive alter ego; it was that Second Life gave him
  the chance to play music, a lifelong dream he‚Äôd never followed. (He would
  eventually pair up with Malin √ñsth to form the duo Bara Jonson and Free.)
  Jonas started playing virtual gigs. In real life he stood in front of a kitchen
  table covered with a checkered oilcloth, playing an acoustic guitar connected
  to his computer, while in Second Life Bara was rocking out in front of a crowd.
  Before a performance one night, a woman showed up early and asked him,
  ‚ÄúAre you any good?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYes, of course,‚Äù and played one of his best gigs
  yet, just to back it up. This woman was Nickel Borrelly; she would become his
  (Second Life) wife and eventually, a couple of years later, the mother of his
  (real life) child.
<br><br>
  Offline, Nickel was a younger woman named Susie who lived in Missouri.
  After a surreal courtship full of hot-air-balloon rides, romantic moonlit
  dances, and tandem biking on the Great Wall of China, the pair had a Second
  Life wedding on Twin Hearts Island‚Äîat ‚Äú12pm SLT,‚Äù the electronic
  invitations said, which meant noon Standard Linden Time. During their vows,
  Bara called it the most important day of his life. But which life did he mean?
  Bara‚Äôs Second Life musical career started to take off, and eventually he was
  offered the chance to come to New York to make a record, one of the first
  times a Second Life musician had been offered a real-life record deal. It was
  Jonas Tancred and Malin √ñsth formed a popular Second Life musical duo called Bara Jonson and
  Free. (Charlotte de la Fuente)
  on that trip that Jonas first met Susie in the real world. When their relationship
  was featured in a documentary a few years later, she described her first
  impression: Man, he looks kinda old. But she said that getting to know him in
  person felt like ‚Äúfalling in love twice.‚Äù How did she end up getting pregnant?
  ‚ÄúI can tell you how it happened,‚Äù she said in the documentary. ‚ÄúA lot of
  vodka.‚Äù
<br><br>
  Susie and Jonas‚Äôs son, Arvid, was born in 2009. (Both Susie‚Äôs and Arvid‚Äôs
  names have been changed.) By then, Jonas was back in Sweden because his
  visa had run out. While Susie was in the delivery room, he was in his club on
  Second Life‚Äîat first waiting for news, and then smoking a virtual cigar. For
  Susie, the hardest part was the day after Arvid‚Äôs birth, when the hospital was
  full of other fathers visiting their babies. What could Susie and Jonas do? Bring
  their avatars together to cook a virtual breakfast in a romantic enclave by the
  sea, holding steaming mugs of coffee they couldn‚Äôt drink, looking at actual
  videos of their actual baby on a virtual television, while they reclined on a
  virtual couch.
<br><br>
  Susie and Jonas are no longer romantically involved, but Jonas is still part of
  Arvid‚Äôs life, Skyping frequently and visiting the States when he can. Jonas
  believes that part of the reason he and Susie have been able to maintain a
  strong parenting relationship in the aftermath of their separation is that they
  got to know each other so well online before they met in real life‚Äîthat Second
  Life wasn‚Äôt an illusion but a conduit that allowed them to understand each
  other better than real-life courtship would have.
  Jonas describes Second Life as a rarefied version of reality, rather than a
  shallow substitute for it. As a musician, he feels that Second Life hasn‚Äôt
  changed his music but ‚Äúamplified‚Äù it, enabling a more direct connection with

  He remembers everyone ‚Äúsinging along‚Äù to a cover he performed of ‚ÄúMmm
  Mmm Mmm Mmm,‚Äù by the Crash Test Dummies, when so many people
  typed the lyrics that their ‚Äúmmm‚Äùs eventually filled his entire screen. For
  Jonas, the reality and beauty of his creations‚Äîthe songs, the baby‚Äîhave
  transcended and overpowered the vestiges of their virtual construction.

  Of the 36 million Second Life accounts that had been created by
  2013‚Äîthe most recent data Linden Lab will provide‚Äîonly an
  estimated 600,000 people still regularly use the platform. That‚Äôs a
  lot of users who turned away. What happened?
  Au sees the simultaneous rise of Facebook and the plateau in Second Life
  users as proof that Linden Lab misread public desires. ‚ÄúSecond Life launched
  with the premise that everyone would want a second life,‚Äù Au told me, ‚Äúbut
  the market proved otherwise.‚Äù
<br><br>
  But when I spoke with Peter Gray, Linden Lab‚Äôs global communications
  director, and Bjorn Laurin, its vice president of product, they insisted that the
  problem doesn‚Äôt lie in the concept, but in the challenge of perfecting its
  execution. The user plateau simply testifies to interface difficulties, they told
  me, and to the fact that the technology hasn‚Äôt yet advanced enough to deliver
  fully on what the media hype suggested Second Life might become: an utterly
  immersive virtual world. They are hoping virtual reality can change that.
  Rosedale predicts that we will come to regard the real
  world as an ‚Äúarchaic, lovable place‚Äù‚Äîno longer crucial.
<br><br>
  In July, Linden Lab launched a beta version of a new platform called Sansar,
  billed as the next frontier: a three-dimensional world designed for use with a
  virtual-reality headset such as Oculus Rift. The company‚Äôs faith, along with
  the recent popularity of VR in the tech world (a trend that Facebook‚Äôs
  purchase of Oculus VR attests to), raises a larger question. If advances in
  virtual reality solve the problem of a cumbersome interface, will they
  ultimately reveal a widespread desire to plunge more fully into virtual worlds
  unfettered by glitches, lags, and keyboards?
<br><br>
  Rosedale stepped down as CEO of Linden Lab in 2008. He told me he thinks
  of himself as more of an inventor, and he felt that the company needed a
  better manager. He isn‚Äôt disappointed in what Second Life has become, but
  he, too, sees the horizon of future possibility elsewhere: in full-fledged virtual
  reality, where he can ‚Äúbuild planets and new economies.‚Äù His current
  company, High Fidelity, is working on creating VR technology so immersive
  that you actually feel like you are present in the room with someone else.
  Au told me that he has noticed a recurrent hubris in the tech world. Instead of
  learning from mistakes, people and companies do the same thing over and
  over again. Is this the story of Second Life‚Äîthe persistence of a tech-world
  delusion? Or is the delusion something more like prophecy? Is Second Life the
  prescient forerunner of our future digital existence?
<br><br>
  When I asked Rosedale whether he stood behind the predictions he‚Äôd made
  during the early years of Second Life‚Äîthat the locus of our lives would
  become virtual, and that the physical world would start to seem like a
  museum‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt recant. Just the opposite: He said that at a certain point we
  would come to regard the real world as an ‚Äúarchaic, lovable place‚Äù that was no
  longer crucial. ‚ÄúWhat will we do with our offices when we no longer use
  them?‚Äù he wondered. ‚ÄúWill we play racquetball in them?‚Äù
<br><br>
  I pressed him on this. Did he really think that certain parts of the physical
  world‚Äîthe homes we share with our families, for example, or the meals we
  enjoy with our friends, our bodies leaning close across tables‚Äîwould someday
  cease to matter? Did he really believe that our corporeal selves weren‚Äôt
  fundamental to our humanity? I was surprised by how rapidly he conceded.
  The sphere of family would never become obsolete, he said‚Äîthe physical
  home, where we choose to spend time with the people we love. ‚ÄúThat has a
  more durable existence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs I think you‚Äôd agree.‚Äù

  Alicia Chenaux lives on an island called Bluebonnet, a quaint forested
  enclave, with her husband, Aldwyn (Al), to whom she has been
  married for six years, and their two daughters: Abby, who is 8, and
  Brianna, who is 3, although she used to be 5, and before that she was 8. As a
  family, they live their days as a parade of idyllic memories, often captured as
  digital snapshots on Alicia‚Äôs blog: scouting for jack-o‚Äô-lantern candidates at
  the pumpkin patch, heading to Greece for days of swimming in a pixelated
  sea. It‚Äôs like a digital Norman Rockwell painting, an ideal of upper-middleclass
  American domesticity‚Äîan utterly unremarkable fantasy, except that
  Abby and Brianna are both child avatars played by adults.
<br><br>
  When Alicia discovered in her early 30s that she couldn‚Äôt have biological
  children, she fell into a lengthy depression. But Second Life offered her a
  chance to be a parent. Her virtual daughter Abby endured a serious trauma in
  real life at the age of 8 (the specifics of which Alicia doesn‚Äôt feel the need to
  know), so she plays that age to give herself the chance to live it better. Brianna
  was raised by nannies in real life‚Äîher parents weren‚Äôt particularly involved in
  her upbringing‚Äîand she wanted to be part of a family in which she‚Äôd get more
  hands-on parenting. Perhaps that‚Äôs why she kept wanting to get younger.
  Alicia and her family are part of a larger family-role-play community on
  Second Life, facilitated by adoption agencies where children and potential
  parents post profiles and embark on ‚Äútrials,‚Äù during which they live together
  to see whether they are a good match. Sara Skinner, the would-be founder of
  the Second Life black-history museum, told me about parenting a 4-year-old
  son played by a man in the armed services deployed overseas: He often logged
  on with a patchy connection, just to hang out with Sara for a few hours while
  his service flickered in and out.

  Sometimes adoptive parents will go through a virtual pregnancy, using ‚Äúbirth
  clinics‚Äù or accessories called ‚Äútummy talkers‚Äù‚Äîkits that deliver everything
  you need: a due date and body modifications (both adjustable), including the
  choice to make the growing fetus visible or not; play-by-play announcements
  (‚ÄúYour baby is doing flips!‚Äù); and the simulation of a ‚Äúrealistic delivery,‚Äù along
  with a newborn-baby accessory. For Second Life parents who go through
  pregnancy after adopting in-world, it‚Äôs understood that the baby they are
  having is the child they have already adopted‚Äîthe process is meant to give
  both parent and child the bond of a live birth. ‚ÄúReally get morning sickness,‚Äù

  one product promises. ‚ÄúGet aches.‚Äù Which means being informed that a
  body-that-is-not-your-corporeal-body is getting sick. ‚ÄúYou have full control
  over your pregnancy, have it EXACTLY how you want,‚Äù this product
  advertises, which‚Äîas I write this essay, six months into my own pregnancy‚Äî
  does seem to miss something central to the experience: that it doesn‚Äôt happen
  exactly how you want; that it subjects you to a process beyond your control.
<br><br>
  In real life, Alicia lives with her boyfriend, and when I ask whether he knows
  about her Second Life family, she says, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Keeping it a secret would
  be hard, because she hangs out with the three of them on Second Life nearly
  every night of the week except Wednesday. (Wednesday is what she calls
  ‚Äúreal-life night,‚Äù and she spends it watching reality television with her best
  friend.) When I ask Alicia whether she gets different things from her two
  romantic relationships, she says, ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù Her boyfriend is brilliant but
  he works all the time; Al listens to her ramble endlessly about her day. She
  and Al knew each other for two years before they got married (she says his
  ‚Äúpatience and persistence‚Äù were a major part of his appeal), and she confesses
  that she was a ‚Äútotal control freak‚Äù about their huge Second Life wedding. In
  real life, the man who plays Al is a bit older than Alicia‚Äî51 to her 39, with a
  wife and family‚Äîand she appreciates that he has a ‚Äúwhole lifetime of
  experiences‚Äù and can offer a ‚Äúmore conservative, more settled‚Äù perspective.
  After their Second Life wedding, everyone started asking whether Alicia and
  Al planned to have kids. (Some things remain constant across virtual and
  actual worlds.) They adopted Abby four years ago, and Brianna a year later,
  and these days their family dynamic weaves in and out of role-play. When
  Brianna joined their family, she said she wanted more than ‚Äújust a story,‚Äù and
  sometimes the girls will interrupt role-play to say something about their real
  adult lives: guy trouble or job stress. But it‚Äôs important to Alicia that both of
  her daughters are ‚Äúcommitted children,‚Äù which means that they don‚Äôt have
  alternate adult avatars. While Alicia and Al share real-life photos with each
  other, Alicia told me, ‚Äúthe girls generally don‚Äôt share photos of themselves,
  preferring to keep themselves more childlike in our minds.‚Äù
  There‚Äôs something stubbornly beautiful about Alicia‚Äôs Second Life family,
  all four people wanting to live inside the same dream.
<br><br>
  For Christmas in 2015, Al gave Alicia a ‚Äúpose stand,‚Äù which allows her to
  customise and save poses for her family: she and Al embracing on a bench, or
  him giving her a piggyback ride. Many of Alicia‚Äôs blog posts show a
  photograph of her family looking happy, often accompanied by a note at the
  bottom. One such note reads: ‚ÄúBtw, if you want to buy the pose I used for this
  picture of us, I put it up on Marketplace.‚Äù In one post, beneath a photograph
  of her and Al sitting on a bench, surrounded by snowy trees, cuddling in their
  cozy winter finery, she admits that she took the photo after Al had gone to
  bed. She had logged his avatar back on and posed him to get the photo just as
  she wanted.
<br><br>
  To me, posing illuminates both the appeal and the limits of family role-play on
  Second Life: It can be endlessly sculpted into something idyllic, but it can
  never be sculpted into something that you have not purposely sculpted.
  Though Alicia‚Äôs family dynamic looks seamless‚Äîa parade of photogenic
  moments‚Äîa deep part of its pleasure, as Alicia described it to me, seems to
  involve its moments of difficulty: when she has to stop the girls from bickering
  about costumes or throwing tantrums about coming home from vacation. In a
  blog post, Alicia confesses that her favourite time each evening is the ‚Äúfew
  minutes‚Äù she gets alone with Al, but even invoking this economy of scarcity‚Äî
  appealing for its suggestion of obligation and sacrifice‚Äîfeels like another pose
  lifted from real-world parenting.
<br><br>
  Last year, Alicia and Al adopted two more children, but found it problematic
  that the new kids wanted ‚Äúso much, so fast.‚Äù They wanted to call Alicia and Al
  Mom and Dad right away, and started saying ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Äù from the
  very beginning. They had a desire for intense, unrelenting parenting, rather
  than wanting to weave in and out of role-play, and constantly did things that
  demanded attention, like losing their shoes, jumping off the roof, climbing
  trees they couldn‚Äôt get down from, and starting projects they couldn‚Äôt finish.
  Basically, they behaved more like actual kids than like adults pretending to be
  kids. The adoption lasted only five months. /There‚Äôs something stubbornly
  beautiful about Alicia‚Äôs Second Life family, all four of these people wanting to
  live inside the same dream. And there‚Äôs something irrefutably meaningful
  about the ways Alicia and her children have forged their own version of the
  intimacies they‚Äôve been denied by circumstances. But their moments of
  staged friction (the squabbling, the meltdowns) also illuminate the
  claustrophobia of their family‚Äôs perfection. Perhaps Second Life families court
  the ideals of domesticity too easily, effectively short-circuiting much of the
  difficulty that constitutes family life. Your virtual family will never fully reach
  beyond your wildest imagining, because it‚Äôs built only of what you could
  imagine.
<br><br>
  One evening during the earliest days of my Second Life exploration, I
  stood with my husband outside a barbecue joint in (offline) Lower
  Manhattan and asked him: ‚ÄúI mean, why isn‚Äôt Second Life just as
  real as ‚Äòreal life‚Äô?‚Äù He reached over and pinched my arm, then said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
  why it‚Äôs not as real.‚Äù
<br><br>
  His point wasn‚Äôt just about physicality‚Äîthe ways our experiences are bound to
  our bodies‚Äîbut about surprise and disruption. So much of lived experience is
  composed of what lies beyond our agency and prediction, beyond our grasp,
  beyond our imagining. In the perfected landscapes of Second Life, I kept
  remembering what a friend had once told me about his experience of
  incarceration: Having his freedom taken from him meant not only losing
  access to the full range of the world‚Äôs possible pleasure, but also losing access
  to the full range of his own possible mistakes. Maybe the price of a perfected
  world, or a world where you can ostensibly control everything, is that much of
  what strikes us as ‚Äúexperience‚Äù comes from what we cannot forge ourselves,
  and what we cannot ultimately abandon. Alice and Bridgette already know
  this, of course. They live it every day.
<br><br>
  In Second Life, as elsewhere online, afk stands for ‚Äúaway from keyboard,‚Äù and
  during the course of his ethnographic research, Tom Boellstorff sometimes
  heard residents saying that ‚Äúthey wished they could ‚Äògo afk‚Äô in the actual
  world to escape uncomfortable situations, but knew this was not possible; ‚Äòno
  one ever says ‚Äúafk‚Äù in real life.‚Äô ‚Äù This sentiment inspired what Boellstorff calls
  the ‚Äúafk test‚Äù: ‚ÄúIf you can go ‚Äòafk‚Äô from something, that something is a virtual
  world.‚Äù Perhaps the inverse of the afk test is a decent definition of what
  constitutes reality: something you can‚Äôt go afk from‚Äînot forever, at least.
  Philip Rosedale predicted that the physical world would become a kind of
  museum, but how could it? It‚Äôs too integral to our humanity to ever become
  obsolete, too necessary to our imperfect, aching bodies moving through it.
<br><br>
  Did I find wonder in Second Life? Absolutely. When I sat in a wicker chair on a
  rooftop balcony, chatting with the legally blind woman who had built herself
  this house overlooking the crashing waves of Cape Serenity, I found it moving
  that she could see the world of Second Life better than our own. When I rode
  horses through the virtual Yosemite, I thought of how the woman leading me
  through the pines had spent years on disability, isolated from the world,
  before she found a place where she no longer felt sidelined. That‚Äôs what
  ultimately feels liberating about Second Life‚Äînot its repudiation of the
  physical world, but its entwinement with that world, their fierce exchange.
  Second Life recognises the ways that we often feel more plural and less
  coherent than the world allows us to be.
<br><br>
  Some people call Second Life escapist, and often its residents argue against
  that. But for me, the question isn‚Äôt whether or not Second Life involves
  escape. The more important point is that the impulse to escape our lives is
  universal, and hardly worth vilifying. Inhabiting any life always involves
  reckoning with the urge to abandon it‚Äîthrough daydreaming; through
  storytelling; through the ecstasies of art and music, or hard drugs, or adultery,
  or a smartphone screen. These forms of ‚Äúleaving‚Äù aren‚Äôt the opposite of
  authentic presence. They are simply one of its symptoms‚Äîthe way love
  contains conflict, intimacy contains distance, and faith contains doubt.
